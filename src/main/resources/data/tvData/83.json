The first show could be watched on TV on 4 October 2005. On 2 November 2010 the 100th episode was aired. The concept of the show is based on the US-American show \u201CExtreme Makeover\u201D \u2013 Home Edition\u201D, which is produced by the TV channel ABC. In this TV show, it is shown how the interior architect Eva Brenner and architect John Kosmalla, as well as approximately 15 workers per show reconstruct diverse rooms in a house within 8 days that was affected by an unlucky incident. That is the reason why families often found themselves in a difficult situation. During the reconstruction work the family will stay in a hotel and is not allowed to get in touch with the building site. In 2009 Eva Brenner and John Kosmalla were supported by Natalie Nguyen-Ton, Christopher Brenner and Daniel Kraft, as well as by a new craftsmen team.\n\nUntil 2005, the family was given a DVD by a member of the building team during the first week of reconstruction. In this DVD, the happenings in their house were presented in a humorous way. Since 2007 the \u201CConstruction Message\u201D was replaced by the \u201CConstruction Riddle\u201D. Eva Brenner sends three items from the building site to the hotel. The family has then to pick one of those items, which represent something. One item represents a blank, for the other two the family gets something in addition, for example a fireplace or an aquarium for their home. Two other categories, which recur in each episode, are \u201CEva\u2019s handicraft tip\u201D and \u201CA craftsman tip\u201D. In these categories Eva or a craftsman tells the spectator how to do handicrafts for the home or how to paper a wall. Besides, in the category \u201CWolfgang\u2019s Building Site ABC\u201D the site manager explains the structure of a building site. The building team has its own kitchen in containers and motor homes, which are located right to the building site and which allows them to work 24\/7.","original_name":"Zuhause im Glück \u2013 Unser Einzug in ein neues Leben","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Zuhause im Glück \u2013 Unser Einzug in ein neues Leben","cert":"Unavailable","id":41304,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["DE"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Le due facce dell'amore is an Italian television series.","original_name":"Le due facce dell'amore","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Le due facce dell'amore","cert":"Unavailable","id":41305,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["IT"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Buffalo Girls is a 1995 television film adapted from the novel of the same name by Larry McMurtry.
