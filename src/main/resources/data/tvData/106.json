This is the first song to win any Eurovision Song Contest in an imaginary language. Ukraine took 2nd place and Lithuania finished 3rd.\n\nThe theme of the event was \"Fun in the Sun\", despite the fact that there were thunderstorms in Lemesos the day of the contest. The stage, which was designed by George Papadopoulos was nominated for the prestigious international \"Live Design Excellence Awards\". The design is an abstract composition and consists of a round stage representing the island of Cyprus, real water along the front of the stage, two jetties, the waves breaking and moving away from the island and five sailing boats with oars.\n\nFor the contest, various changes to the rules were made. One was that adults could assist children to write the songs submitted to their national broadcaster; previously only children could write the songs, with no assistance from adults. Another change was only six people could be on stage during a performance, instead of eight. The most significant change, however, was only half of the vote was decided by the tele-voters. Before the 2008 contest tele-voters completely decided the whole result. The other half of the result was decided by a jury of adults and children.","original_name":"Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2008","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2008","cert":"Unavailable","id":52832,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"2NE1TV","vote_average":0.0,"name":"2NE1TV","cert":"Unavailable","id":52833,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Krovim krovim: The Reunion","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Krovim krovim: The Reunion","cert":"Unavailable","id":52834,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Pura Química","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Pura Química","cert":"Unavailable","id":52835,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["AR"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Prik Tai Gub Bai Kao","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Prik Tai Gub Bai Kao","cert":"Unavailable","id":52846,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["TH"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Sood Tae Jai Ja Kwai Kwa","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Sood Tae Jai Ja Kwai Kwa","cert":"Unavailable","id":52847,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["TH"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Dong Poo Dee","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Dong Poo Dee","cert":"Unavailable","id":52848,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["TH"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Songkran Hang Kwarm Ruk","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Songkran Hang Kwarm Ruk","cert":"Unavailable","id":52849,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":"2013-04-04","cast":["Arisa Noto"],"overview":"Killing Goods are murder weapons handed down from generation to generation within the families of their owners.
