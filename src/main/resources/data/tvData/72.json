There were 46 films in the series, made between 1960 and 1965.\n\nThe films were loose adaptations of Edgar Wallace's books and stories. Very few used his original titles, and there was no attempt to set them in the period in which Wallace wrote, probably to obviate the need for elaborate costumes and sets. A 1962 article in Scene magazine quotes £22,000 as the budget for an episode then in production.\n\nMost of the series featured a uniform title sequence, in which a shadowed bust of Edgar Wallace revolves slowly against a backdrop of swirling mist, to the accompaniment of the \"Man of Mystery\" theme written by Michael Carr. \"Man of Mystery\" was later recorded by The Shadows and became a no. 5 hit record in the UK.\n\nThe series has achieved lasting popularity through repeated showings on television. In Britain it was seen on ITV, Channel 4 and Bravo at various times from the late Sixties through to the Nineties. It was shown on U.S. television as The Edgar Wallace Mystery Theatre, with episodes cut to fit hour-long commercial TV slots.\n\nIn July 2012 Network DVD began to release the complete series on DVD, uncut and presented in its original widescreen cinema aspect ratio.","original_name":"Edgar Wallace Mysteries","vote_average":7.0,"name":"Edgar Wallace Mysteries","cert":"Unavailable","id":35580,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[9648,18],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Day and Date was a daily hour-long syndicated program in the 1990s.

Makai Senki Disgaea follows the same general plot as the game, but with several alterations to character roles and the chronology of events. The anime was licensed by Geneon Entertainment before closing their doors in 2007. On September 1, 2010, North American anime distributor Funimation Entertainment announced that they have rescued the series and will release the complete series in 2011.\n\nA bonus feature on the DVD of Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories was a trailer of what the Disgaea anime would look like. The trailer showed mainly scenes from episode 1 of the game where Laharl is awakened by Etna and he challenges Mid Boss in his castle. Also shown were Flonne's descent into the Netherworld, Gordon piloting his ship through space, and a peculiar battle between Laharl and Baal. However, the anime turned out to be completely different from what was shown in the trailer. No explanation was given for the drastic departure of the final anime from the trailer.
