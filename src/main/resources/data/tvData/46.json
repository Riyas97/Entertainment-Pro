The image of each person's face is then projected onto a two-way mirror positioned in front of the lens of the other's camera. Instead of looking at a blank lens, then, both Morris and his subject are looking directly at a human face. Morris believes that the machine encourages monologue in the interview process, while also encouraging the interviewees to \"express themselves to camera\".\n\nThe name \"Interrotron\" was coined by Morris's wife, who, according to Morris, \"liked the name because it combined two important concepts \u2014 terror and interview.\"\n\nOne episode was dedicated to debtor's advocate Andrew Cappocia, wherein he laid out his philosophy on debt reduction. Shortly after the series aired, Cappocia was tried and convicted of fraud and is currently serving a 15 year sentence.","original_name":"First Person","vote_average":0.0,"name":"First Person","cert":"Unavailable","id":22868,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[99,10763],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":"2007-06-23","cast":["Travis Barker","Wil Francis","Andrew W.K.","Kevin Lyman"],"overview":"","original_name":"Warped Hall of Fame","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Warped Hall of Fame","cert":"Unavailable","id":22869,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":"2006-10-03","cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Design Interns","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Design Interns","cert":"Unavailable","id":22870,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["CA"]},{"first_air_date":"1986-01-07","cast":["Thom Hoffman"],"overview":"","original_name":"Wassende water, Het","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Wassende water, Het","cert":"Unavailable","id":22871,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["NL"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Living Live!","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Living Live!","cert":"Unavailable","id":22872,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Style Court","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Style Court","cert":"Unavailable","id":22873,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":"2004-01-01","cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"America's Deadliest Season","vote_average":0.0,"name":"America's Deadliest Season","cert":"Unavailable","id":22874,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"After Midnight","vote_average":0.0,"name":"After Midnight","cert":"Unavailable","id":22875,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Me and Mr. Jones","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Me and Mr. Jones","cert":"Unavailable","id":22876,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":"2000-07-16","cast":["Richard Hatch","John Dykstra","Anne Lockhart","Dirk Benedict","Glen A.
