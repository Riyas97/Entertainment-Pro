It was based primarily on the book The Richest Girl In The World: by Stephanie Mansfield as well as Bob Colacello's two in-depth articles about Ms Duke in Vanity Fair. Colacello was the magazine's authority on Doris Duke.\n\nThe title of the series was derived from the book Too Rich: The Family Secrets of Doris Duke by Pony Duke and Jason Thomas. Manfield's book was the first to be obtained by CBS, which optioned it for a planned miniseries in early 1995. The Duke-Thomas book, which was \"being peddled as a miniseries\" by the authors months before publication, was originally optioned earlier that year by the producer Doris Keating, who planned a miniseries of her own.\n\nToo Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke presents a dramatized account of the life of the heiress, philanthropist, and once richest woman in the world, Doris Duke. It has since been re-broadcast on The Hallmark Channel, and on Lifetime combined together and presented as a 192 minute movie. The film stars Hayden Panettiere as young Doris Duke, Lindsay Frost as 20 to 50 year old Doris Duke, and Lauren Bacall as an elderly Doris Duke. Bacall, who had met Doris Duke a few times, was pleased to have been able to appear in a TV miniseries, devoting a few paragraphs to the experience in her autobiography.","original_name":"Too Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke","vote_average":2.0,"name":"Too Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke","cert":"Unavailable","id":15590,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"A Child's Hope is a MediaCorp TV Channel 8 Chinese drama which stars Tay Ping Hui, Phyllis Quek and Huang Biren.

Due to the shows limited filming budget the initial deadline was not met and the Bogans parted ways with Madman over a percentage dispute while negotiating a new deal.\n\nAlthough originally designed to be a DVD series, Bogans on the Run will now begin airing as a webcast on ManiaTV in 2008 which is good news for the fans that have been hanging out for the shows release as they can now access all the madness of Bogans on the Run for free.","original_name":"Bogans on the Run","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Bogans on the Run","cert":"Unavailable","id":15934,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[35],"origin_country":["AU"]},{"first_air_date":"1982-11-14","cast":["Gregory Peck","Rip Torn","Lloyd Bridges","Robert Vaughn","Stacy Keach"],"overview":"The Blue and the Gray is a television miniseries that first aired on CBS in three installments on November 14, November 16, and November 17, 1982.
