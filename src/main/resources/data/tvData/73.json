The program was hosted by popular disc jockey Ken Sparkes, who was one of the main presenters at Melbourne pop radio station 3UZ. In 1965, after the end of his previous series, Teen Scene, pop singer Johnny Chester became the associate producer of the program.\n\nIt was produced by the Willard King organisation for Melbourne TV station ATV-0 and was pre-recorded on videotape at the station's Nunawading studio. It was originally seen only in Melbourne, but was later relayed to interstate stations in the newly-formed 0-10 Network as they came on line during 1965\u201366.\n\nThe Kommotion format was a fast-paced, teenage Top 40 pop music show. It was originally shown in daily half-hour episodes, Monday\u2013Friday at 5.30 pm; an additional one-hour special on Sundays was added later in the run of the series.\n\nIn August 1964 Channel 0 premiered its first pop TV program, The Go!! Show. It proved such a ratings success that its original 13-episode contract was extended to 39 episodes after only seven weeks on air, and this encouraged Channel 0 to capitalise on this success by commissioning a second series that would appeal to younger viewers. Both programs showcased the emerging 'beat' pop trend, and provided an energetic alternative to the mainstream family-oriented variety format of the rival Nine Network program, Bandstand. In combination, Go!! and Kommotion gave the nascent 0-10 Network an unbeatable lead in pop TV programming, with The Go!! Show alone regularly pulling in over 400,000 teenage viewers every week.","original_name":"Kommotion","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Kommotion","cert":"Unavailable","id":36060,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["AU"]},{"first_air_date":"2003-10-18","cast":[],"overview":"The Big Read was a survey on books carried out by the BBC in the United Kingdom in 2003, where over three quarters of a million votes were received from the British public to find the nation's best-loved novel of all time.

The series was first serialized in Akita Shoten's monthly shōnen manga magazine, Champion Red, in 2005. It has since been compiled into eleven tankōbon, as of November 20, 2008. The story centers around Kouichi Hayase, a fourteen-year-old boy living a mediocre life, until an accident turns him into the pilot of a gigantic robot called \"Linebarrel\" and leads him to encounter a mysterious girl.\n\nAn anime adaptation of the manga series was announced in the February issue of Animage magazine. The anime is directed by Masamitsu Hidaka and animated by Gonzo. Though the world premiere of the first episode took place at Southern California's 2008 Anime Expo, the series premiered in Japan on the television network TBS on October 3, 2008. The anime broadcast a total of twenty-four episodes, the last of which aired on March 20, 2009. To commemorate the series' anime adaptation, Shimizu and Shimoguchi decided to create a one shot manga, recreating the entire first episode of the anime, in which the plot differs in many aspects compared to the beginning of the manga.","original_name":"鉄のラインバレル","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Linebarrels of Iron","cert":"Unavailable","id":36248,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18,16,35,18],"origin_country":["JP"]},{"first_air_date":"2009-04-04","cast":["Ayumi Fujimura","Kenji Akabane","Taimei Suzuki","Kazuhiko Kishino","Atsushi Imaruoka"],"overview":"Shin Mazinger Shogeki!

According to the production staff, it has no relation to the 1970s show and should not be described as a Mazinger Z remake. The series is a \"retelling\" of the basic story of Mazinger Z, featuring most of the same characters, mechanical beasts, and some general plots of the original series, plus some additional material. It keeps the original plot line of Mazinger Z, but makes references to other Go Nagai works, such as Z Mazinger, Violence Jack, Mao Dante and others. Elements from other related Mazinger works appear in the series, such as the story of Kedora and the appearance of Energer Z, the original concept before Mazinger Z.\n\nAlong with the TV series, a new manga, Shin Mazinger Zero started on April 18, 2009 in the magazine Champion Red. The pair responsible for the shōnen manga Akumetsu, Yoshiaki Tabata and Yuki Yogo, write and illustrate the Shin Mazinger Zero manga.
