The theme for the show seemed appropriate for an event scheduled during the hot summer month of July. The beach\/\"fun in the sun\" theme was also reflected in the places where WCW chose to hold the event; all of the shows emanated from cities in either Florida or California, two U.S. states renowned for their warm weather. It was WCW's response to WWF's SummerSlam. In 1992 and 1993, WCW held a beach-themed pay-per-view show known as Beach Blast, which was the forerunner to Bash at the Beach. The 1992 show was held in June, however, as the company elected instead to reserve July for its flagship summertime extravaganza, The Great American Bash. Along with Starrcade, SuperBrawl, The Great American Bash, and Halloween Havoc, Bash at the Beach was booked to be one of WCW's flagship events.

This series follows the adventures and developing friendship of two pre-teenaged boys known as Ben and Izzy, who are from the United States and Jordan respectively, as well as a desert genie known as Yasmine, who takes the form of a young girl closely resembling the age of the boys.\n\nDespite the fact the series was produced in Jordan, it was primarily released in English for international purposes before its official Arabic dub in 2008. The series was created primarily to entertain, but it was also created as an educative experience about certain aspects of Arab history, and how it affected Western culture, which is also the forming of the bond between the Western Ben and the Eastern\/Arab Izzy. This in turn represents a comprehensible and possible union of Western and Eastern\/Arab cultures, in spite of the current prejudice views of each culture in the other. There are currently 13 episodes created, although 26 were originally planned.","original_name":"Ben & Izzy","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Ben & Izzy","cert":"Unavailable","id":17466,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[16],"origin_country":["JO"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Power Play is a Canadian public affairs television show which airs weekdays on CTV News Channel.
