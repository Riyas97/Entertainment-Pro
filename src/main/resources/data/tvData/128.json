Right before she finally gets her wish, she learns that her beloved older sister Jin-yoo has died. Jin-yoo was betrayed and killed by her lover, Jang Tae-jung. Tae-jung, a smart, good-looking man from a humble background, had committed himself to luring and marrying a tycoon's daughter \"against all odds,\" as part of an effort to get him into the upper class of society.\n\nSeon-yoo then meets Seo Ji-seok, an immature man from a rich family whose sister Ji-hee is married to Tae-jung. Ji-seok is at risk of losing the inherited family business to Tae-jung and Ji-hee, since Ji-seok's mother is the family patriarch's second wife.\n\nTo take revenge on the man responsible for her sister's death, Seon-yoo gives up her dream of becoming a nun. She marries Ji-seok, and becomes Tae-jung's sister-in-law. Thus, Seon-yoo begins leading a double life: she pretends to be the ideal wife and daughter-in-law in front of the Seo family, and only takes off her mask in front of Tae-jung, proving she can be just as ruthless and vicious as Tae-jung. Seon-yoo wears her angel wings while hiding the dagger of revenge.","original_name":"천상여자","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Angel's Revenge","cert":"Unavailable","id":63945,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18,10751,10749],"origin_country":["KR"]},{"first_air_date":"1992-12-29","cast":["Ruth-Maria Kubitschek","Gudrun Landgrebe","Marita Marschall","Sophie von Kessel","Mathieu Carrière"],"overview":"","original_name":"Schloß Hohenstein - Irrwege zum Glück","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Schloß Hohenstein - Irrwege zum Glück","cert":"Unavailable","id":63946,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18],"origin_country":["DE"]},{"first_air_date":"1990-11-30","cast":["Helga Göring","Andreas Schmidt-Schaller","Jaecki Schwarz","Horst Krause","Bruno Carstens"],"overview":"","original_name":"Spreewaldfamilie","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Spreewaldfamilie","cert":"Unavailable","id":63947,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[10751],"origin_country":["XG"]},{"first_air_date":"1979-01-06","cast":["Suzanne von Borsody","Herbert Stass","Rosemarie Fendel","Ilona Grübel","Lisa Kreuzer"],"overview":"","original_name":"Beate S.","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Beate S.","cert":"Unavailable","id":63962,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[10751,18],"origin_country":["DE"]},{"first_air_date":"1976-07-21","cast":["Rolf Castell","Karin Anselm","Klaus Herm","Diether Krebs","Martin Semmelrogge"],"overview":"","original_name":"Block 7","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Block 7","cert":"Unavailable","id":63963,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18],"origin_country":["DE"]},{"first_air_date":"1975-12-11","cast":["Walter Sedlmayr","Bruni Löbel"],"overview":"","original_name":"Spannagl & Sohn","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Spannagl & Sohn","cert":"Unavailable","id":63964,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[10751],"origin_country":["DE"]},{"first_air_date":"1974-11-26","cast":["Günther Maria Halmer","Frithjof Vierock","Michaela May"," Therese Giehse","Ruth Drexel"],"overview":"","original_name":"Münchner Geschichten","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Münchner Geschichten","cert":"Unavailable","id":63965,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18],"origin_country":["DE"]},{"first_air_date":"2015-09-01","cast":["Sibella Court"],"overview":"Over two years, International Designer Sibella  Court, follows the trials and tribulations of 7 groups of Australians  committed to the daunting task of restoring heritage ruins into living  homes.
