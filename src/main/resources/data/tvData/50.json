When asked about the manga, Mohiro Kitoh stated that he had about 80% of the entire story planned out from the beginning. When he was asked about the anime series, he stated he was grateful it was made. In the United States, it was licensed by Dark Horse and serialized in Super Manga Blast!\n\nThe 13-episode anime adaptation was broadcast in 2003 on the Japanese television station Kids Station. The anime was licensed by Central Park Media and released as Shadow Star Narutaru, and has played on Comcast's Anime Selects multiple times. In 2007 it ran on the Illusion on Demand television network. Central Park Media released the title under their \"U.S. Manga Corps\" line, on 4 DVDs, and later re-released the DVDs in a box set. Central Park Media filed for bankruptcy in 2009, and the DVDs have since been out of print.\n\nThe protagonist of the series is a twelve-year-old girl named Shiina Tamai. She bonds with a starfish-shaped \"dragonchild\" whom she calls Hoshimaru.

NBC asked Cooper to write the script for the premiere, \"First Person Singular\", which is told entirely from the point of view of an unseen murderer who kills his obnoxious wife and winds up being executed. Variety gave this first episode a rave review (\"undoubtedly one of the best dramatic shows yet seen on a television screen\"), but Lights Out did not become a regular NBC-TV series until
