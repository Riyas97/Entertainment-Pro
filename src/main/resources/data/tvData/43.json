It relies heavily on archival documents and interpretations from historians and members of both the Indigenous and European community and leaders.

It explores the lives of particular individuals and uses their stories as a vehicle to explain the larger situations of the time. It explains violent aspects of European settlement of Australia, such as killings, battles, wars, as well as acts of friendship and decency between the early European settlers and Indigenous Australians.

Alice looks to Joe for help but he ignores her predicament and gets off the train. A few days later, the police are seeking witnesses to a sexual assault against Alice. Joe unwillingly comes forward but, when giving evidence against the men in court, cannot bring himself to admit that he did nothing to save Alice.\n\nThe film was commissioned by the BBC's director of serials Laura Mackie at the outline stage. Marchant did not want to extend the script to any more than two parts because he thought two was the right length. He previously worked with Morrissey and producer David Snodin on the 1997 television series Holding On. The script went through five drafts; refinements included making Joe's wife less judgemental, and seeing other characters in the wider world reacting to Joe. It was filmed over 30 days.\n\nThe first part received 6.9 million viewers, and the second part 6.7 million. The second part was the first time BBC One won the 9\u201310 p.m. timeslot in two months.

I almost forgot: 'hello!' I sing and dance almost by myself - in the program Ma Pit'om.\". The show consisted of Kishkashta asking questions of himself as well as of the Israeli children who were his co-hosts. Nira Rabinovitch, today a famous Israeli new age figure, co-starred with Kishkashta in many of the show episodes, and sang the song Ma Pit'om with Kishkashta in the opening act.\n\nIn Israel, the cactus is a symbol of Israeli-born Jews, called sabras, as opposed to those who immigrated later, even though the cactus itself is not a native plant.
