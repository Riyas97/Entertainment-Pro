The series had a strong cast and considerable financial backing, especially from Julia Roberts's Shoelace Productions, Spelling Television and Revolution Studios, however poor ratings forced its cancellation after three episodes.\n\nThe idea for the series came about when two New York attorneys, twin brothers Dan and Peter Thomas, were discussing courtroom stories based on their shared experiences in Queens while on a plane flight to California in 2001. One of the passengers, a Hollywood producer, was sitting next to them and mentioned that they could be the basis for a television series. Indeed, the producer brought the idea to screenwriter Kevin Fox who later successfully pitched it to CBS. Fox was initially hesitant in becoming involved, feeling there were too many courtroom dramas already, but agreed after spending time at the New York Supreme Court himself.","original_name":"Queens Supreme","vote_average":0.5,"name":"Queens Supreme","cert":"Unavailable","id":18505,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[35,18],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Noor Pur Ki Rani is a Pakistani drama serial that was aired on Hum TV.

A 1946 program, for example, dramatized humanitarian Lilian Wald's founding of New York City's Henry Street Settlement in 1895. A May 31, 1959, program featured a tour of the Holy Land narrated by Ralph Bellamy.\n\nBeginning in 1952, The Eternal Light was also televised by NBC as part of its Sunday morning religious programming, along with Frontiers of Faith and the Catholic Hour. By the mid-1950s, the program had an audience of more than six million weekly on radio and television.\n\nMilton E. Krents was executive producer of The Eternal Light radio program for 44 years. NBC television's director for The Eternal Light, along with its other Sunday morning televised religious programs, was Martin Hoade. The program's editor was Moshe Davis of the Jewish Theological Seminary, who explained its purpose to a New York Times interviewer: \"The common man is always the hero in our show. We try to put a contemporary subject in a concept of eternity.\" NBC donated the air time and the Jewish Theological Seminary budgeted the show's production expenses.

Eastern time, the same time slot as Saturday repeats of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson during its first season, then to replace Saturday Night Live, once a month on those weekends when the SNL cast was not producing a show. The program was awarded a George Foster Peabody medal in 1975 and attracted a cult following.\n\nThe program was hosted by Lloyd Dobyns, who also did much of the reporting. The show's creator and executive producer was past president of NBC News, Reuven Frank. Together, Dobyns and Frank were largely responsible for the distinctive writing and quirky style of the program.\n\nIn 1978, after four years of critical success and moderately good ratings for that hour, NBC moved Weekend to prime time. After airing once a month in various time slots in September, October, and November, the network placed the program weekly on Saturday nights at 10 P.M. Eastern time starting in December of 1978. Linda Ellerbee was added as Dobyns' co-host and co-lead reporter. Placed against strong programs on ABC and CBS, the show eventually died of poor ratings. A few years later, Ellerbee and Dobyns reunited to anchor another late-night NBC news program, NBC News Overnight.","original_name":"Weekend","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Weekend","cert":"Unavailable","id":18948,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[10763],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Treasures of the British Crown","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Treasures of the British Crown","cert":"Unavailable","id":18949,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[99],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"When Hell was in Session","vote_average":0.0,"name":"When Hell was in Session","cert":"Unavailable","id":18950,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Las Rosas Blancas","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Las Rosas Blancas","cert":"Unavailable","id":18951,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Amber Waves","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Amber Waves","cert":"Unavailable","id":18952,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Broken Arrow: Can a Nuclear Weapons Accident Happen Here?","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Broken Arrow: Can a Nuclear Weapons Accident Happen Here?","cert":"Unavailable","id":18953,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[99],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"One Plum Blossom is a 25 episodes popular TV series shown in CTV starring Shen Hai-jung and Kou Shih-hsiun.","original_name":"One Plum Blossom","vote_average":0.0,"name":"One Plum Blossom","cert":"Unavailable","id":18954,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Call It Macaroni","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Call It Macaroni","cert":"Unavailable","id":18957,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Down at the Dunbar","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Down at the Dunbar","cert":"Unavailable","id":18958,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"A Sunday Journal","vote_average":0.0,"name":"A Sunday Journal","cert":"Unavailable","id":18959,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":"1999-07-05","cast":["Maria Yamamoto","Takehito Koyasu","Tomokazu Seki"],"overview":"Amazing Nurse Nanako is an anime OVA series released in Japan.

Nanako is a classic ditzy slapstick protagonist who tends to accidentally break things and do everything wrong. Ogami treats her frequently in a cruel or heartless manner\u2014threatening her, yelling at her and even subjecting her to physical abuse\u2014yet at the climax of every episode he comes through to rescue her from whatever predicament she got herself into. Much of the series revolves around the relationship between Nanako and Ogami\u2014his mean veneer, her faith in him, and how he alternates between the evil mad scientist archetype and the knight in shining armor archetype.\n\nAs the series progresses we are gradually revealed the history between Nanako and Ogami's family and given a reason why the two are so tightly knit together, as well as why the title refers to Nanako as a \"nurse\". A minor supporting cast is introduced, though Nanako and Ogami are clearly the leads. The plot incorporates the American military, the Catholic Church and outlandish science fiction experiments, with these elements progressed mostly in the lead episode and the last two episodes. The middle episodes 2-4 feature mostly unrelated one-shot plots, though minor progress is made in each episode regarding the history between Nanako and Ogami's family.","original_name":"Amazing Nurse Nanako","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Amazing Nurse Nanako","cert":"Unavailable","id":18960,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[16,35],"origin_country":["JP"]},{"first_air_date":"2008-08-04","cast":["Richard Dawkins"],"overview":"The Genius of Charles Darwin is a three-part television documentary, written and presented by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins.\n\nIt was first shown in August 2008 on Channel 4.
