Each client has the option of awarding the job either to the lowest bidder, or to a higher bidder based on feedback from previous clients. Ties are broken in favor of the carrier with the higher average feedback rating. Winners load their cargo and attempt to deliver it intact by the client's deadline. Feedback ratings from clients are displayed as the loads are delivered. At the end of the episode, each carrier's net profit or loss is tallied on-screen, with the expenses subtracted from the bid amount to determine the overall profit or loss.
