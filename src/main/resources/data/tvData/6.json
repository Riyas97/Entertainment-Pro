It was later syndicated to 60 other stations across the country by Westwood One, a division of CBS Radio, airing weekdays from 5:30 to 10 am Eastern time. Beginning September 3, 1996, the 6 to 9 am portion was simulcast on the cable television network MSNBC.\n\nThe show had been broadcast almost every weekday morning for 25 years on radio and 11 years on MSNBC until it was canceled on April 12, 2007 due to controversial comments made on the April 4, 2007 broadcast. The remark resulted in the program's cancellation the following week.\n\nThe Imus in the Morning program returned to the morning drive on New York radio station WABC on December 3, 2007. WABC is the flagship station of ABC Radio Networks, which syndicates the show nationally. From 2007 to August 2009, the show was simulcast on television nationwide on RFD-TV and rebroadcast each evening on RFD HD in high-definition.
