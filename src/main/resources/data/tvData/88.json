The film, which was written by Myrdal, has been labeled as \"one of the first successful political films in Sweden.\" It tells the story of a man, myglaren, who works for the well-being of the employees at an organization presented as \"the movement\", hinting at the labour movement or the Social Democrats. Through various schemes, he is able to climb the ladder of success and foster himself and his work. The man works flexibly and manipulates his surroundings, allowing him to build a successful career and become a known name in Swedish well-being research. At the end he is assigned to start a governmental authority to foster the well-being of people in the society. The film shows his way to the top through fancy dinners, relationship making, and his handling of the media. Myglaren is 86 minutes long and was filmed in black-and-white.\n\nChrister Strömholm plays the lead role in the film. The film was a sensation in Sweden and after six airings on television, it reached a larger audience than any prior Swedish film had. Myglaren was a sharp, modern social satire, a format that is unlikely to have been used in any previous Swedish films. Following the multiple airings of Myglaren, the noun \"myglare\" has been a common expression in Sweden. The dictionary Svensk ordbok defines it as a person who advances his or her own interests by scheming.","original_name":"Myglaren","vote_average":5.0,"name":"Myglaren","cert":"Unavailable","id":43976,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":"2012-04-21","cast":["Im Chang-jung","Seo Young-hee","Lee Se-eun","Choi Gyu-hwan"],"overview":"Ji Woon-soo's Stroke of Luck is a 2012 South Korean television series that aired on cable channel TV Chosun from April 21 to June 24, 2012 on Saturdays and Sundays at 18:50 for 20 episodes.
