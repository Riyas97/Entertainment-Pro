[{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Bold Journey was a travelogue program broadcast by ABC television in the United States during the late 1950s.\n\nBold Journey consisted of films taken by explorers and adventurers during their travels to remote parts of the world. The films were usually set up by an interview between a program host and the guest, who then narrated his film with the aid of helpful questions from the host. The program was first telecast on July 16, 1956 and ended with the August 31, 1959 show. The initial host was John Stephenson; Jack Douglas became host effective with the October 28, 1957 broadcast.\n\nInitially shown on Monday nights, Bold Journey was moved to Thursday nights in February 1957, but was returned to Mondays, in a later time slot, in June of that year. Beginning that fall, Bold Journey would be very little-seen, as it was scheduled against Tales of Wells Fargo on NBC and Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts on CBS; both were popular programs. The next fall, while Bold Journey remained opposite Wells Fargo on NBC, its new competition from CBS in its time slot was the even more popular Father Knows Best. Bold Journey became one of the lowest-rated prime time programs of its era, but managed to remain on the air as long as it did due to its very low production costs relative to scripted programs, which was an important factor to ABC, which in that era had a considerably smaller budget than the other two U.S. commercial television networks. However, in the fall of 1959, ABC decided to forgo this approach and attempt to compete directly for viewers with the other networks in this time slot, and Bold Journey was replaced by one of the most expensively produced series of the era, Warner Bros.' Cheyenne.","original_name":"Bold Journey","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Bold Journey","cert":"Unavailable","id":14000,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":"2004-05-04","cast":["Jack Blumenau","Emily Wheaton","Hannah Greenwood","Cameron Nugent"],"overview":"Noah and Saskia is a 13-episode children's television program co-produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and British Broadcasting Corporation.

Although the earliest works were marked by television drama drawing on its theatrical roots, with live performances telecast from the television studio, a shift towards shooting on film occurred in the late 1970s, utilising techniques and working methods common in the cinema, but use of the term has persisted.","original_name":"Television play","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Television play","cert":"Unavailable","id":14176,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":"2003-03-06","cast":["Dean Gaffney","Samantha Fox","Donna Air"],"overview":"The Club was a British reality television show, broadcast weekly on ITV.

Writer Frank Deasy and producer Nigel Stafford-Clark were inspired to make a drama that opened up the story beyond the \"vacuum\" it is often told in. They did this by expanding the roles of Pontius Pilate and Caiaphas, and exploring the politics of Judea at the time. Deasy and Stafford-Clark were aided by scholar Mark Goodacre, with whom they put together an extensive research manual about the topic.\n\nThe part of Jesus is played by Joseph Mawle, who researched the role by reading the Gospels and research papers. Other main roles were played by Paloma Baeza, Ben Daniels, James Nesbitt, David Oyelowo, and Penelope Wilton. It was directed by Michael Offer on location in Morocco from 27 August to 23 October 2007, and broadcast on BBC One in four parts from 16 to 23 March 2008.

A pilot show was recorded with Big Daddy presenting, assisted by Isla St Clair and short films were shot with Big Daddy to insert in the upcoming series; a trailer for \"Big Daddy's Saturday Show\", complete with logo was shown on ITV the Saturday morning before the show was due to air. It was then announced during the week that Big Daddy was dropping out and that Isla St Clair would now take the lead, with ex-Magpie host Tommy Boyd assisting and with Jeremy Beadle being used as an occasional \"stand in\" host. The actor David Rappaport was also a fixture playing the character \"Shades\", as was soccer legend, Jimmy Greaves.\n\nIt was never made publicly clear why Big Daddy dropped out so close to transmission; no settlement was ever reached between him and Central.\n\nThe second season of the show featured a regular technology spot called 'Interface'. Presented by IT journalist Chris Palmer, it featured a couple of notable TV firsts. It broadcast a computer programme live which viewers could record from their TV and upload to a Spectrum. The initial attempt failed due to interference on the feed from the studio floor, but it was re-broadcast the following week and many viewers successfully recorded and loaded the programme. The second 'first' for the show was the game 'Up for Grabs' which was a game played live in the studio by a player in their own home via a computer and a modem. The contestant had to steer a robotic arm and pick up prizes from a rotating turntable. This proved incredibly difficult as the contestants found it difficult to gauge the depth of the arm and also the response time of the robot arm was slow.

The entire programme, therefore, was a series of flashbacks as the couple recounted the earlier days of their romance.\n\nFilled with witty and sparkling banter, the episodes featured comic situations ranging from problems with mistaken identity to decorating and makeover mishaps.\n\nIn homage to George Burns and Gracie Allen, CD would end each episode with the phrase \"Say goodnight, Clara.\"\n\nThe series is based on the novels Coronet Among the Weeds and Coronet Among the Grass written by Charlotte Bingham, who was co-creator of the TV series with her husband Terence Brady.\n\nThe theme song for No, Honestly was written and performed by Lynsey De Paul.

Not to be confused with the latter, the Canned Film Festival featured B movies as the centerpiece for each television episode, and was composed of short vignettes interwoven throughout the films. Boasting the tagline \"late night with the best of the worst,\" the series was promoted and sponsored by the Dr Pepper Company, whose then-tagline \"out-of-the-ordinary\" echoed the show's collection of odd and strange movies. The series was created by Young & Rubicam and developed for television by Chelsea Communications, LLC.\n\nAlthough similar in style to the successful Mystery Science Theater 3000 series that aired a few years later, the Canned Film Festival differed in that its comedy scenes occurred strictly during the commercial intermissions instead of adding peanut gallery type satire during the actual run of the movies. In addition, the script, although comedic in nature, often reflected upon the serious contextual and cultural subjects contained in the featured movies, sometimes providing historical insight into their production. An example is seen during the episode featuring Project Moonbase, where female spaceship commanders were discussed as an accurate future prediction by the 1950s era movie, as were cordless telephones and big screen televisions.

What Schama does do, however, is tell the story in vivid and gripping narrative terms, free of the fustiness of traditional academe, personalising key historical events by examining the major characters at the centre of them. Not all historians would approve of the history depicted here as shaped principally by the actions of great men and women rather than by more abstract developments, but Schama's way of telling it is a good deal more enthralling as a result. \n\nSchama successfully gives lie to the idea that the history of Britain has been moderate and temperate, passing down the generations as stately as a galleon, taking on board sensible ideas but steering clear of sillier, revolutionary ones. Nonsense. Schama retells British history the way it was--as bloody, convulsive, precarious, hot-blooded and several times within an inch of haring off onto an entirely different course. Schama seems almost to delight in the goriness of history. Themes returned to repeatedly include the wars between the Scots and the Irish and the Catholic\/Protestant conflicts--only the Irish question remains unresolved by the new millennium. As Britain becomes a constitutional monarchy, Schama talks less of Kings and Queens but of poets and idea-makers like Orwell.

After a brief introductory segment, the show is basically an interview between the guest and the show's host Aleksandar Stanković, croatian journalist of born in Serbia.\n\nAnother feature of the show is a phone line poll about an issue related to the guest. The poll recently became matter of controversy, when many people, dissatisfied with the results - most notably Andrija Hebrang, high-ranking official of the Croatian Democratic Union - accused Croatian Radiotelevision of vote stuffing and manipulation. Recently the poll lost much of its importance due to small number of respondents and results that contradict each other every week.\n\nThe show started in 2001 and gained a lot of popularity, mostly due to Stanković taking adversarial approach towards the guests and asking all kinds of unpleasant questions. For a while, Nedjeljom u dva enjoyed a reputation of the most influential television show in Croatia. But this reputation was recently put in question when Stanković's approach began to backfire, manifesting itself in straw poll results. It is believed that the trend started in 2009 with Borislav Škegro and Zlatko Canjuga - two unpopular figures in the former Franjo Tuđman's government - outclassing Stanković during the debates. In recent months Stanković fared the same in the debate with a Serbian journalist Aleksandar Tijanić, while the worst debacle was the debate with Nenad Ivanković, which, according to witnesses, nearly led to physical confrontation after the show. Also a guest of the show in December 2007, Bosnian Serb politician Milorad Dodik called the opening segment about him 'biased' and confronted Stankovic with the fact he was never officially found guilty of cigaret smuggling, as claimed by the show.","original_name":"Nedjeljom u dva","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Nedjeljom u dva","cert":"Unavailable","id":14472,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":"2007-11-07","cast":["Trinny Woodall","Susannah Constantine"],"overview":"Trinny & Susannah Undress the Nation is a British reality fashion-themed television documentary series on ITV featuring fashion advisors Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine.\n\nThe newly formatted series, stemming from Trinny & Susannah Undress..., began to air on ITV on 7 November 2007, and explores some of the major fashion problems in Britain.

The format of each programme involved experts monitoring the behaviour of the family and the children, before discussing with the parents the real underlying causes of the problem, which frequently involved the parents themselves. The experts then discussed a course of action with the parents, later coaching them on how to change their own and their children's behaviour to improve the situation. This was frequently achieved in scenes where the family was filmed in a communal activity, with the parents receiving advice from the attending professional via an ear piece. In addition to its entertainment value, Little Angels gave viewers strategies to deal with common problems, and offered real help to the family being filmed. The show's experts, Tanya Byron, Stephen Briers, Rachel Morris and Laverne Antrobus, became household names.\n\nLittle Angels was the first in a series of reality television programmes to focus on parenting, with successors including The House of Tiny Tearaways. Considered among the strongest of BBC Three's programmes by Stuart Murphy, then the channel's controller, it was praised for reflecting \"real day to day issues\" in a government-commissioned report on the channel.
