The humour revolves around the expensive and ludicrous preparations that are required when there is an official visit from a member of the Royal Family. The workers recognise this and cannot take it seriously. Management recognises it but has to play the game. Special toilets must be constructed \"just in case\" and then destroyed after the visit. A worker is instructed to paint a brick holding up a window. On the eve of the visit the slogan \"Scargill rules OK\" is painted on a wall. The manager comments \"When I find out who did that I'll string him up by his knackers\". It is a surreal situation for many of the miners who obviously bear no love for Royalty.\n\nThe second deals with a pit accident where some men are killed, and attempts to rescue some trapped men.

Pranks were played all over the UK, with most taking place in London and the South East, although specials were filmed abroad.\n\nIn contrast to other CBBC programmes, Stitch Up! was more aimed at older children and teenagers. The presenters and victims were all teenagers and adults with comparatively little child participation. The soundtrack\/background music was often sultry and urbane, featuring bands like Oasis and Royksopp.\n\nNotable pranks included Anne Foy pretending to be a news reader, appearing on TV screens in an electrical store, revealing embarrassing stories about a victim, who was watching the screens in horror whilst shopping with his family. Another surreal, ongoing sketch involved actors in knights' costumes and other strange outfits, fighting and doing bizarre things in a busy street, to the confusion of shoppers. Calum Callaghan played a boy who invited people to play card games with him in a train station and always accused them of cheating. Marvin Benoit played street magician 'David Plain' - a spoof of the famous magician David Blaine. Simon Kane played Remote Controlled Kid in all three series.

There were seven episodes that aired over the summer of 2003, the last ending on a cliff-hanger.

Produced by the Central Office Of Information for the Health and Safety Executive, it was shown extensively in the Southern, Anglia and Westward areas, before being shown either on film or videocassette in primary schools. The 26 minute-long film deals with the subject of the dangers to children on farms, and has been seen in schools all over Britain, as well as Canada, Australia and the United States. The timeframe of the film is somewhat confusing, giving a surreal feeling to the events portrayed. Written by Neville Smith and directed by John Mackenzie, Apaches is now one of the most notorious public information films of all time.\n\nThe film, which dovetails the narrative conventions of the western with PIFs, follows the misadventures of a group of six young children in a rural British village, who enjoy playing on a nearby farm. Throughout the film the children play at being \"Apache warriors\", hence the film title. All but one die in various shocking accidents, largely due to the children's carelessness, suggesting that the children would still be alive if they had known what dangers lay ahead. Other commentators have suggested however that the adults were also responsible, as they appear several times and don't attempt to stop the children.","original_name":"Apaches","vote_average":8.0,"name":"Apaches","cert":"Unavailable","id":19850,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Short Circutz was a series of short computer animated videos that were played between television shows on YTV every weekend afternoon and evening from September 10, 1994 until September 1, 1996. Most videos were 30 to 120 seconds long, often played between other computer animated shows, such as ReBoot and Beasties. The videos were all sampled from three film collections: The Mind's Eye, its sequel Beyond the Mind's Eye and Imaginaria. Some of the films were re-edited with alternate music and sometimes songs, in order to appeal to children.\n\nThe YTV Viewer Relations Department had this to say, in regards to the reason behind these shorts:\n\nIn the past, YTV had only 8 commercial minutes per hour all day, compared to the conventional standard of 12. Often, programs that were acquired for broadcast on YTV had been formatted for the additional commercial time and therefore required interstitials, such as 'Short Circutz', Public Service Announcements or promos to fill left over air time.

It was made by Cosgrove Hall and consists of two series of thirteen 11-minute episodes each, made between 1999 and 2000. The show was co-written by the animation partnership of David Max Freedman and Alan Gilbey, and occasionally with Joel Jessup as a third writer. It was directed by Jon Doyle.\n\nThe show is primarily set on Foxearth Farm, a fictional farm based in the English countryside which is dominated by a variety of animals, particularly the chickens. The Foxbusters are three chickens, Ransome, Sims and Jeffries, who have the unlikely ability to fly. Each has a different personality; Ransome is the best flyer, Sims is the smartest and Jeffries is the comic relief. The Foxbusters also have the ability to spit grit like machine guns, and drop hard-boiled eggs like they were bombs - and these are used to effect among other methods to keep the hungry pack of foxes in Foxearth Forest at bay.\n\nThe arguments and conversations between the chickens makes an effective comedy. The foxes' attempts to get the better of the chickens are often unsuccessful, but they add a lot of humour to the show. The show itself is laden with gags and action, and is of a quality which led to its receiving two major awards in 2000. One was a BAFTA for 'Best Animated Series' and the other was from the British Animation Awards for 'Best Children's Series'.","original_name":"Foxbusters","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Foxbusters","cert":"U","id":19854,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[16,35],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":"2003-08-04","cast":["Kenji Nojima","Katsunosuke Hori","Yukitoshi Hori","Junko Hagimori","Shunsuke Shima"],"overview":"Blue Gender is a 26-episode anime created by Ryōsuke Takahashi broadcast in Japan from 1999-2000.
