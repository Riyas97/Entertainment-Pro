Though set in a tropical hotel with palm trees, sunshine and beautiful beaches, for practical reasons all interiors scenes - and the bulk of exterior scenes - were shot at the Ten Network's studios in Nunawading, Melbourne. The exterior set made heavy use of awnings in an attempt to disguise Melbourne's propensity for overcast skies, but attempts to mask the icy breath of the bathing beauties was not always successful. Attempts to shoot location footage in Queensland were hampered by the fact that the local television crews assigned to the shoot had experience only in shooting news footage, and the fact that heavy rain fell for several days of a planned shoot.

If you cook low and slow then you can use all sorts of rubs and smoking agents to infuse the food with a depth of flavour you just can\u2019t get out of an oven.

The series dealt with the students of Hartley High, a tough high school in a multi-racial area of Sydney, and proved to be a more gritty and fast-paced show than many of its contemporaries. It was a spin-off of the 1993 Australian feature film The Heartbreak Kid which had featured Alex Dimitriades and Claudia Karvan. However, in later seasons the show shifted emphasis away from the school setting and the Poulos Family to the students' homes and hangout - the Shark Pool.","original_name":"Heartbreak High","vote_average":6.4,"name":"Heartbreak High","cert":"Unavailable","id":12998,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18],"origin_country":["AU"]},{"cert":"Unavailable","cast":[],"id":12999,"first_air_date":null,"overview":"","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["PH"],"original_name":"Bagets","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Bagets","adult":"false"}]
