Its cult appreciation has also stemmed from the fact that Toad Patrol had so much time and effort put into it. This series has a very distinct beginning, middle, and end to each season it airs.

The judge decides after hearing the case who is morally right and how much to award. If he finds one party to be merely wrong, he'll award a $500 cash prize. If he finds it to be a more serious moral problem, he terms it offensive, and awards a $1,000 cash prize. If he finds it to be extremely bad, he terms it outrageous, and awards the show's maximum judgment, a $2,000 cash prize. The judge could also dismiss the case if he finds both parties to be wrong. After every case on Moral Court, court reporter\/interviewer Vivian Guzman would ask both parties a few questions and let them say their opinion on the outcome of the case. Out of all other court shows on television to this day, Moral Court was the only court show that dealt with ethics and morality rather than legality, hence why the parties were not referred to as the \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\", but rather, the \"Accuser\" and the \"Accused\". The cases on the show would generally not be taken in a legal court. Moral Court received bad reviews and low ratings, resulting in the show not being renewed for a second season.

The programme was dropped by RTÉ as part of its new season of television in 2010, to be replaced by two afternoon programmes 4 Daily presented by Maura Derrane and The Daily Show hosted by Dáithí Ó Sé and Claire Byrne.\n\nThe television show, the last season of which was presented by Sheana Keane and Maura Derrane, was a mix of lifestyle, information and fun items. The show included cookery, fashion, health, fitness, parenting, life-coaching and celebrity gossip. Viewers also had the opportunity to text, phone and e-mail in interjections, views, experiences and opinions, and they were given a chance to win prizes in a daily quiz.\n\nThe Afternoon Show had met with a mixed reaction since it first appeared on screens in 2004, presented by Bláthnaid Ní Chofaigh and Anna Nolan. This was partly because it replaced the hugely popular show Open House. There was speculation that the show has not proved as successful as its predecessor and that it would not return for a second season. However, a second series began in 2005, although one of the former presenters, Sheana Keane, did not return.","original_name":"The Afternoon Show","vote_average":0.0,"name":"The Afternoon Show","cert":"Unavailable","id":4973,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":"2006-02-20","cast":["Gabriela Spanic","Catherine Siachoque","Ariel López Padilla","Francisco Gattorno","Géraldine Bazán"],"overview":"Tierra de Pasiones is a Spanish-language telenovela produced by Telemundo which is owned by NBC Universal.

It aired at 8 p.m. Eastern time, 7 p.m. Central time, and postgame in the Mountain and Pacific time zones. The June 24 finale aired at 8 ET\/PT and 7 CT\/MT as the finals had ended by this time, with the San Antonio Spurs being crowned champions.\n\nThe event was taped at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina, using cars provided by the Jeff Gordon racing school. Kenny Mayne and Brad Daugherty were the hosts. Corey LaCosta from the racing school was the celebrities' driving instructor and head official for the competition.\n\nIn an interesting sidelight, the promos that aired in the Mountain and Pacific zones mention the show aired after the \"basketball finals,\" not giving the NBA's name or initials. This was because, despite the exclusive rights to air the finals, ABC could not mention the NBA in connection to this show's leadout. A possible reason was that Gillette is the title sponsor of this series; it is a competing product to Schick, a NBA sponsor at that time.","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"],"original_name":"Fast Cars and Superstars: The Gillette Young Guns Celebrity Race","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Fast Cars and Superstars: The Gillette Young Guns Celebrity Race","adult":"false"}]
