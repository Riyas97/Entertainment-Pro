The original mystery is a Chilean telenovela ¿Dónde Está Elisa? produced by TVN in 2009.\n\nTelemundo began airing ¿Dónde Está Elisa? on March 8, 2010 airing weeknights at 10pm\/9c over about 26 weeks during the 2010 season. As with most of its other telenovelas, the network broadcasts English subtitles as closed captions on CC3.\n\nThe first sneak peek of the production was shown on Tuesday in January 13, 2010. The series was produced in Miami Florida. The filming started on January 27 and ended in May, 2010. In July 26, the series shared the 1 hour time slot with another Telemundo telenovela La Diosa Coronada. The last episode of the series was aired on Tuesday in August 10, 2010.\n\nA question is how much of DEE is based on the successful book The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, a 2009 Swedish film adaptation of the novel Män som hatar kvinnor by the late Swedish author\/journalist Stieg Larsson. DEE was written or adapted by Pablo Illanes, who wrote the Chilean version that preceded that of Telemundo. Illanes says that the inspiration of the story comes from the book and the real life drama of British native Madeleine McCann in Portugal. The list of suspects is long, and it includes family members, fellow students, and friends of the teenager who went to the same places that she used to go to before disappearing. There is a striking similarity between DEE and the previously aired Desaparecida, a relatively short telenovela aired in Spain.","genre_ids":[9648,10759],"origin_country":["US"],"original_name":"¿Dónde Está Elisa?","vote_average":0.0,"name":"¿Dónde Está Elisa?","adult":"false"}]
