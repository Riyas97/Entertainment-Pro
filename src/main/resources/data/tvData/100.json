The series was co-produced by Millimages and Schlessinger Media; it was distributed by the latter. The program ran daily on BBC2 and CBBC from 2001 to early 2002, before it was discontinued due to a lack of both episodes and audience. The series was one of the last few educational TV programmes still shown by the BBC on CBBC. It is one of its most short-lived television series, running for only 26 15 minute episodes. The programme aims to teach basic principles of science to young viewers and revolves around the residents of the backward Mammoth Island as they struggle through daily life with the use of outlandish contraptions. The series was later dubbed into French and briefly aired in syndication on TV network France 5. A DVD containing all 26 episodes of the series was released in 2005.","original_name":"The Way Things Work","vote_average":0.0,"name":"The Way Things

It was written by six writers including Robert Bloch.\n\nDuring naval exercises in 1978 Captain Nemo is found in suspended animation aboard his submarine Nautilus beneath the Pacific Ocean. Revived by members of a modern day US Government agency, Nemo is persuaded to rescue United States interests and in so doing battle Professor Cunningham, a typical mad scientist played by Burgess Meredith.\n\nNot originally aired as a movie, it was broken into three parts, expanded somewhat with about 45 minutes of additional footage over the three episodes to become a very brief action series. Sometimes described as a \"miniseries,\" it was intended to be the first story-arc in an ongoing serial. Ratings were dismal, and the series never materialized.\n\nInstead this proved to be Irwin Allen's final foray into weekly science fiction television.\n\nThe film was a co-production between Irwin Allen Productions and Warner Bros. Television.
