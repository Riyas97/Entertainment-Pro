Crossroads adopted the instrumental break in the Jayhawks indie hit Blue as its theme song.\n\nCrossroads was criticized by viewers for being a non show that aired standard rotation videos rather than alternative videos. Many alternative artists were never shown while Pop artists such as Hootie & The Blowfish, Natalie Imbruglia and even The Rolling Stones had videos air on the show. The few actual alternative acts that were featured had crossover hits and were in rotation on VH1. Despite this the shows hosts insisted that the videos on the show were \"Too peculiar for regular airplay\" and \"Left of center of mainstream\".

The members of the program were singers who had been influenced by the American rock n' roll of the late 1950s and British Invasion bands of the 1960s, though the music often became softer, more naïve versions with light, romantic lyrics aimed at teenagers. They were Roberto Carlos, Erasmo Carlos and Wanderléa, with other bands and musicians appearing on the show as guests.\n\nThe style became popularly known as \"iê-iê-iê\", a term that, like French yé-yé, is most likely based on the freqüent \"yeah\" cries heard in songs of the period. Iê-iê-iê was often considered a lesser genre, inferior to the more sophisticated bossa nova and MPB music of the period. Jovem Guarda also became a lucrative business thanks to merchandise that explored its theme and even a couple of themed motion pictures were shot during the period, thus reinforcing the idea of its lack of artistic integrity. However, by the late sixties and early seventies, singers Erasmo Carlos and Roberto Carlos had shown a more mature side to their work and, later, even MPB singers, as Nara Leão, Maria Bethânia, Gal Costa and Elis Regina, would add their material to their repertoires. For a long time, the program was the leader of the audience \"youth Sunday afternoons,\" as the song of Sunday Afternoons Young, Roberto Carlos. But from the end of 1967, audience numbers began to fall, probably as a result of overexposure of the artists, who attended all the programs in order to maximize their income. The spread of the rock led to the artists who performed in the program were depreciated on charges of sold and Americanized by a section of the public preferred the songs of the festivals and then Tropicalia. Thanks to \"Young Guard,\" Brazilian rock began to be recognized throughout South America appeared most avant-garde artists as well, and impressed by the music of youth in the program, as Raul Seixas to his songs with religious themes, mystical and strange and Rita Lee songs that mocked the Brazilian music scene old and new and the strange appearance of the rock by the sight of a middle class mother. The style of the songs were romantic and unconcerned with politics, which led many intellectuals to mock and be against the program that never spoke out against the dictatorship. The most famous episodes was when the release of the album Roberto Carlos \"The inimitable\" artists and intellectuals began to call the singer of \"The Brazilian-Americanized and alienated.\" The exact difference between the Young Guard led by Roberto Carlos and Tropicalismo Caetano and Gilberto Gil, is not in excencia but the influence they had: The young guard Roberto Carlos was very influenced by American rock, while the Tropicalismo was influenced by British rock more intellectual. In Tropicalism still had the influence of Bob Dylan.","original_name":"Jovem Guarda","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Jovem Guarda","cert":"Unavailable","id":16557,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"The Cleverest is the Ukrainian and Russian telecast of the intellectually entertaining character, one of the most popular versions of the British teleproject «Brainiest».","original_name":"The Cleverest","vote_average":0.0,"name":"The Cleverest","cert":"Unavailable","id":16558,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":"2006-01-20","cast":[],"overview":"Haunted Homes is a British reality television series made by September Films Productions.

Left wing composers and writers would try to squeeze subversive lyrics in the contest, with great effect. After the 1974 revolution Portugal became increasingly open to foreign culture, thus deeming the Festival as a lesser musical event, dominated by below standard pop songs with little or no impact in the industry, although remaining a high audience TV show.\n\nThe 90's saw a recovery of the contests image, then considered a viable means for a new singer to start a career. Internationally acclaimed Portuguese singers Dulce Pontes and Sara Tavares made their debut in the 91 and 94 editions respectively. Many other unknown performers like Lucia Moniz and Anabela leaped to national stardom after taking the RTP trophy.\n\nAfter reaching and all-time high 6th place in the 1996 edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, the festival steadily declined from then on. In 2000 the winner Liana did not participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2000, as Portugal had for the first time been relegated due to consecutive poor showings. In 2002 the FEstival da Canção wasn't organized, contradicting the tradition of staging a Festival da Canção even without participating in that year's Eurovision Song Contest, as happened in 2000 and 1970. Since 2001, the festival saw consecutive changes of format. 2005 saw RTP commissioning a song for eurovision, rather than organizing some kind of competition. Since 2006 RTP seemingly settled for a traditional multi-singer, multi-composer competitive format, claiming the memory of older contests and songs. Producers have since been invited to come up with songs, lyrics and singers, and the 2007 result with Sabrina almost making it to the Eurovision final, gave RTP the necessary confidence boost to maintain the current format. In 2009 an open call for songs was held by RTP, abolishing the invited producers method, with online voting deciding the qualifiers to the televised final from a list of 24 songs, with 12 competing in the live contest.","original_name":"Festival da Canção","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Festival da Canção","cert":"Unavailable","id":16862,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["PT"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Sharpe's Mission is a British television drama, part of a series that follows the career of Richard Sharpe, a British soldier during the Napoleonic Wars.

The show was dedicated to hard rock and heavy metal music videos, and showcased a variety of well and lesser known artists. It balanced coverage of major international acts, with newer bands, and a variety of Canadian acts both major label and independent. For example, members of Canadian bands such as Brighton Rock, Helix, and Triumph were invited to co-host the show. On other installments, independent artists such as Mif from Slash Puppet were brought in for live, in-studio interview segments. International artists also often co-hosted, such as Iron Maiden, Rob Halford, and Motorhead.\n\nThe format of the program varied, but in general it was hosted live by one of MuchMusic's VJ's. The VJ would play new and old metal videos, taped interviews, play requests, and go over recent metal news. Fans were encouraged to write in requests every week, and the most creative of which were often shown. The show offered contests, for prizes such as meeting or interviewing bands, or for rare merchandise. Frequently, episodes would feature live interviews with artists in or outside the MuchMusic studio. Occasionally, artists would also perform songs live in the studio. A notable example was Rik Emmett, who co-hosted an episode and played the then-new Triumph single \"Let the Light\" acoustically before jamming with his co-writer Sil Simone in a guitar battle. Emmett was later brought back to co-host a special episode entitle The Axemen Cometh, which showcased popular guitar soloists of the time.","original_name":"Pepsi Power Hour","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Pepsi Power Hour","cert":"Unavailable","id":16958,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"What Are You Talking About?","vote_average":0.0,"name":"What Are You Talking About?","cert":"Unavailable","id":16959,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Fabiola is a Venezuelan telenovela that was produced by and seen on Venevisión.
