It starts in 1984 with their admission interviews, then follows them through five or six years as medical students, and ends with their first experiences of working as busy junior hospital doctors in the National Health Service.\n\nThe BBC decided to make the series in 1983 and the BBC contacted several medical schools. The BBC selected St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, England, partly because the Dean, Prof Peter Richards, was enthusiastic about filming and thought that medical education was of public interest. Filming began in November 1984 when applicants were applying for university and going to interviews for the 1985 intake at St Mary's Hospital Medical School. St Mary's Medical School interviewed 419 applicants and 100 of these interviews were filmed. In the autumn of 1985, when studies had started, every student in the year was asked if they wanted to take part in the television series, and 10 students, who were thought to be outgoing and resilient to the pressures of filming, were chosen by the BBC.

Corbett felt he had a promising career as a serious actor, but was trapped by his role as Harold and forced to keep returning to the series after typecasting limited his choice of work. Brambell, meanwhile, was a homosexual, something that in the 1960s was still frowned upon by traditional English society and, until the Sexual Offences Act 1967, illegal, and was thus driven underground.

Harry H. Corbett's nephew from his second marriage also released a statement which claimed that the actors did not hate each other. \"We can categorically say they did not fall out.

The unrehearsed program, sponsored at one point by Colgate-Palmolive, was created by veteran vaudevillian \"Senator\" Edward Ford, who claimed he was taking part in a joke session at a New York theatrical club when he conceived the idea. However, the format was quite similar to a prior joke-telling radio series, Stop Me If You've Heard This One, which featured Ford and cartoonist Harry Hershfield as panelists. Many jokes involved ethnic humor told in dialect.\n\nListeners contributed approximately 3,000 jokes a week. Host Peter Donald told the best of these jokes, each one centered around a different topic, while a \"laugh meter\" took note of the audience reaction. The \"Knights of the Clown Table\" - Ford, Hershfield and Joe Laurie, Jr. - attempted to top listeners with their own jokes, which sometimes presented an extra challenge as their jokes had to be pertinent to the topic.\n\nAny submission used on the program received ten dollars. Each time a panelist failed to top Peter Donald's joke, an additional five dollars was added, so a listener could potentially win as much as $25, though on many occasions Donald's jokes would score perfect 1000s which would guarantee the top prize to the submitter regardless of how the rest of the panel fared. Further, listeners were also given phonograph recordings of Peter Donald telling their jokes on the air. The panelists claimed that together they knew over 15,000 jokes.","original_name":"Can You Top This?","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Can You Top This?","cert":"Unavailable","id":20797,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Weekend Magazine was a long-running television show, shown by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

At this time, WFIL-TV was said to be \"#4 in a three-station market.\"\n\nThe main difference between Action News and Eyewitness News was that the former was far more tightly formatted. Time limits were set on packages\u2014for instance, a reporter package could be no longer than 90 seconds. This difference enabled the station to cover more stories than its competitors. Another key difference was the focus on the surrounding Philadelphia suburban areas\u2014a response to the movement of residents from the city to the suburbs. Finally, WPVI placed more emphasis on young talent\u2014while WCAU-TV and KYW-TV used older, respected news anchors such as Vince Leonard, Tom Snyder, and John Facenda, WPVI used a young Larry Kane as their top anchor. Later, the station would add the very popular Jim O'Brien as its main weathercaster.\n\nThe format quickly took off, and after going back and forth with KYW for first place, WPVI took the lead in 1977 and has held it ever since.
