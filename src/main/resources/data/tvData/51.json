When he joined the Army he developed this interest into a skill and put it to good use. Learning how to survive in the Australian bush and then to teach others the same skills. He wrote various survival manuals for the Australian Armed forces and added survival notes to the back of maps used by pilots flying over the Australian bush. In this series of programmes Les shares that knowledge with us, teaching us some of his survival skills and his great respect for the Aboriginal people that taught him.","original_name":"Bush Tucker Man","vote_average":9.0,"name":"Bush Tucker Man","cert":"Unavailable","id":25418,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[99],"origin_country":["AU"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Hinch","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Hinch","cert":"Unavailable","id":25419,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["AU"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Dreamhome","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Dreamhome","cert":"Unavailable","id":25420,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["AU"]},{"first_air_date":"2006-01-31","cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Take One Museum","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Take One Museum","cert":"Unavailable","id":25421,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":"1988-02-19","cast":["Tim Healy","Richard Griffiths","Robin Bailey","Frances de la Tour","Anita Carey"],"overview":"","original_name":"A Kind Of Living","vote_average":0.0,"name":"A Kind Of Living","cert":"Unavailable","id":25430,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":"1963-08-08","cast":["Francis Matthews","Isa Miranda","David Kossoff","Diana Coupland","Martin Miller"],"overview":"","original_name":"A Little Big Business","vote_average":0.0,"name":"A Little Big Business","cert":"Unavailable","id":25431,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":"1991-07-05","cast":["Anne Reid","Jean Alexander","Jason Flemyng","Lorraine Ashbourne","Lionel Jeffries"],"overview":"","original_name":"Rich Tea And Sympathy","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Rich Tea And Sympathy","cert":"Unavailable","id":25432,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Bank on the Stars","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Bank on the Stars","cert":"Unavailable","id":25433,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Three Rousing Tinkles","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Three Rousing Tinkles","cert":"Unavailable","id":25434,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":"1997-02-18","cast":["Declan Donnelly"],"overview":"","original_name":"Ant And Dec Unzipped","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Ant And Dec Unzipped","cert":"Unavailable","id":25435,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Rockline on MTV","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Rockline on MTV","cert":"Unavailable","id":25444,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"S.O.S.

It premiered in 1996.\n\nHGTV states that Gardening by the Yard is for people who want their yards to look great but don't have time to spend on them. James focuses on the lighter side of gardening and practices organic gardening. Topics include composting, correct watering, plant zones, vegetable gardens, planting plants that are natural to your area, and many other gardening basics.\n\nMost of the show is taped in James' Tulsa, OK backyard. James is not afraid to show flaws in his yard as he claims this makes the show a real gardening program. James will also have occasional guest gardeners give their own tips for specific fruit and vegetable crops such as growing fruit trees in containers or designs for the garden. James often takes the show to locales across the country to visit other gardens or locally owned nurseries. The show has featured many guest stars over the years including James Gonzalez and Alexis Stewart.\n\n2009 was expected to be the last year for the show as it has not been renewed. However, as of mid-2010, reruns are shown early weekday mornings.\n\nAs of January 2012, the show no longer appears on HGTV's schedule, but visitors to HGTV.com can find short web-cast reruns of the show.","original_name":"Gardening by the Yard","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Gardening by the Yard","cert":"Unavailable","id":25458,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":"2001-11-04","cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"On Home Ground","vote_average":0.0,"name":"On Home Ground","cert":"Unavailable","id":25459,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":"2003-03-12","cast":["Bae Doo-na","Kang Dong-won","Kim Yu-mi"],"overview":"Two girls with a twisted fate, born on the same day, Lee Eun Hee (Bae Doo Na) and Lee Keum Hee (Kim Yoo Mi) live their lives as sisters.
