They were scheduled to begin in July 2009 and continue through to March 2010. However, with all concerts sold out, Jackson died less than three weeks before the first concert date. Jackson officially announced the concerts at a press conference held inside The O2 Arena stated that This Is It was going to be his final series of concerts. AEG Live, the concert promoters, released a promotional video that took up an entire commercial break, setting a record for ITV. The shows were to be Jackson's first major series of concerts since the HIStory World Tour finished in 1997, and had been cited as one of the year's most important musical events. Randy Phillips, president and chief executive of AEG Live, stated that the first 10 dates alone would have earned the singer approximately £50 million.\n\nOriginally only 10 concerts were announced, but the tickets were sold out in less than an hour and the public demand for tickets resulted in 40 more concerts being added, making 50 in total. Ticket sales broke several records and AEG Live stated that Jackson could have sold more dates. Jackson's album sales increased following the announcement. In preparation for the concert series, the pop singer had been collaborating with numerous high profile figures, such as fashion designer Christian Audigier, choreographer Kenny Ortega and bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno. Prior to Jackson's death, Allgood Entertainment sued the entertainer for $40 million, claiming that he had breached an exclusivity agreement with them by agreeing to the This Is It concerts. The case was later dismissed.\n\nIn light of Jackson's death, AEG Live offered either full refunds to all ticket holders or a special souvenir ticket designed by the entertainer. The cancelled shows, the record-breaking ticket sales [1][2][3] and the potential for a world tour,[4][5] made Jackson's shows \"the greatest concert[s] that never happened.\"[6][7] Columbia Pictures acquired the footage of the show rehearsals and made a concert film titled Michael Jackson's This Is It. The Jackson estate received 90% of the profit made while the remaining 10% went to AEG Live. Columbia Pictures guaranteed at least $60 million for the rights. To coincide with the release of the concert footage, an accompanying album was released.","original_name":"This is it","vote_average":8.0,"name":"This is it","cert":"Unavailable","id":57290,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[99],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"\/m\/0562n7t","vote_average":0.0,"name":"\/m\/0562n7t","cert":"Unavailable","id":57291,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Martina & Esko: Vauvakuumetta","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Martina & Esko: Vauvakuumetta","cert":"Unavailable","id":57292,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Martina & Esko: Isku Kolumbiaan","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Martina & Esko: Isku Kolumbiaan","cert":"Unavailable","id":57293,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Fax was a 1991-1992 Argentine talk show, hosted by Nicolás Repetto.

There have been many well-known foreigner guests like sprinter Ben Johnson, basketball player Dennis Rodman and ice hockey player Börje Salming, but usually the guests were Finnish athletes or other celebrities. The show could also involve musical performances.\n\nMaybe the most renowned regular joke of the show was so called \"rabbit gag\", a video clip where a rabbit makes invasion to the piste during biathlon competition and runs a while above the group of skiers like an artificial rabbit in greyhound racing. The clip was shown sometimes when some of the competitor asks.

The questions concern people and events in recent news, and a short parody of a news report appears between each round.\n\nAlso like Maailman ympäri, SF-Studio has four contestants, two of which are men and two women, and two are celebrities and two ordinary people.\n\nSF-Studio has one main prize: a holiday trip. Where the trip is located depends on the choices in the fourth and final round. There are five different options, starting from a cheap trip inside Finland, and getting progressively more expensive and further away, with the best option being a trip to some famous sunny beach holiday resort near the Equator.\n\nSmaller prizes are recently published Finnish books, all autographed by some Finnish celebrity who has nothing whatsoever to do with either the book or its author.","original_name":"SF-Studio","vote_average":0.0,"name":"SF-Studio","cert":"Unavailable","id":57464,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[35],"origin_country":["FI"]},{"first_air_date":"2005-12-20","cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Gordon Ramsay Cooks Christmas Dinner","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Gordon Ramsay Cooks Christmas Dinner","cert":"Unavailable","id":57465,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":"2011-10-05","cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"De Allerslechtste Chauffeur Van Nederland","vote_average":0.0,"name":"De Allerslechtste Chauffeur Van Nederland","cert":"Unavailable","id":57466,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":"2013-09-19","cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"The Incredible Spice Men","vote_average":0.0,"name":"The Incredible Spice Men","cert":"Unavailable","id":57467,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":"2011-11-13","cast":["Emmanuelle Yacoubi"],"overview":"","original_name":"Manipulations : une histoire francaise","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Manipulations : une histoire francaise","cert":"Unavailable","id":57470,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[99],"origin_country":["FR"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Tummesagor","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Tummesagor","cert":"Unavailable","id":57471,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":"1998-05-17","cast":["David Suzuki"],"overview":"Complex and deeply mysterious, the human brain is an odyssey unto itself.
