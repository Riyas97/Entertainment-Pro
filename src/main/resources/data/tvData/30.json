Most characters were voiced by Jean Roucas, who also acted as the show's host.\n\nAlthough some French politicians expressed appreciation for their caricatures, some have greeted them with less enthusiasm. Jean-Marie Le Pen sued the show, as he disliked being represented as the vampire \"Pencassine\", shown wearing a traditional girl's costume from Brittany - a reference to \"Bécassine\", a 1910s classic French comic character, and to Le Pen's origins in Brittany, while retaining his vampire fangs. Édith Cresson expressed great displeasure at her own puppet: she was depicted as an air-headed panther, submissive to the sexual whims of \"Kermitterrand\".\n\nSuccess began to decline with the competition from Les Guignols de l'info.

Winchell would have none of this. Still wearing his felt \"reporter\" hat on the air, and punching out bogus \"Morse Code\" with his telegraph key to punctuate his stories, Winchell came across as a relic of another era. Even his trademark opening line, \"Good evening Mr. and Mrs. North and South America and all the ships at sea ... let's go to press!\" seemed obsolete by 1960.\n\nThe revived Winchell program was a Nielsen ratings disaster and was cancelled after only six broadcasts.

The show is very similar in style to Mr. Bean, with the basic premise being that Uncle Max is incapable of embarking on any adventure without upsetting another individual or group of individuals in some shape or form.\n\nThe first series was filmed in Johannesburg in South Africa and produced by Andy Rowley over a seven-week block in the summer of 2005, the show was written by David Schneider and 13 episodes were made for CITV and screened on the CITV channel in 2006.

Scheider also stated that the name of the Uncle is descended from his own uncle, Max Ward, who was born in Hastings but now lives in Hackney, London.

Ansara had earlier appeared in the series Broken Arrow, having portrayed the Apache chief, Cochise. Ansara, however, was not Native American but of Syrian descent.\n\nAnsara played Sam Buckhart, an Apache Indian who saved the life of a U.S. Cavalry officer after an Indian ambush. When the officer died, he left Sam money that was used for an education at private schools and Harvard University. After school, he returned to New Mexico where he became a Deputy Marshal working for Marshal Andy Morrison. He lived in a boarding house run by Martha Commager. The only other continuing character was 8-year old Tess Logan, an orphan who had been rescued by Buckhart. Robert Harland, later of Target: The Corruptors! starred in seven episodes as Deputy Billy Lordan.

As was commonplace in British television at the time, the series was broadcast live and very few episodes survive in the archives: only three of the original 148 episodes. One of the few surviving shows was transmitted on BBC Four in 2004. A film version produced in 1955 by the Butchers company, written by the Pertwees and starring the television cast, exists as an example of the series. The film was titled It's a Great Day.\n\nIn 1991, during a special day of programming transmitted on the BBC Two network to commemorate the closing of Lime Grove, a new edition of the programme was shown: a modern production of one of the original scripts with the roles filled by popular television soap opera actors of the day including Leslie Grantham.\n\nPeter Bryant, who starred as Jack Grove, went on to become a script editor and producer on the BBC science fiction series Doctor Who.

No. 73 had been revamped during its final series as 7T3, with a partially exterior set. However, the new 7T3 set-up was expensive and difficult to produce, and so it was decided to switch to a fully studio-based set-up. The new show was produced as the same studio complex as its predecessor, and many of the production team transferred to the new show. Whereas No. 73 had included an inherent narrative storyline, the decision was taken that Motormouth would have a straightforward magazine presentation format.\n\nThe studio set for the first series was dominated by several giant inflatable elements, including a giant motorised mouth, from which the show took its name. In the second series, billed in some cases as Motormouth II or Motormouth 2, there were changes, including the introduction of new graphics and set elements based on cogs and sprockets.

It was produced by the Nine Network in conjunction with Paramount Pictures.\n\nThe series centres on the action and adventures of lead actor Jack Thompson's character Erskine, and his main support character, Peter Sumner's Gunthar Haber. It was the first lead role for Jack Thompson. The two are part of an elite unit of special operatives, the Special Intelligence Unit, and their adventures are loosely based upon those of the real Services Reconnaissance Department who often operated behind Japanese-held lines during the war. Unlike most previous war films, Spyforce deliberately steered away from the notion that the United States was solely responsible for Japan's defeat, and highlights the important role Australian forces played in the defeat of the Imperial Japanese Army. Producer Roger Mirams was also careful to avoid stereotypes of the genre, and tired formulas for the battle scenes.\n\nThe idea appealed to American producers Paramount Pictures, who backed creator Roger Mirams to begin production without having seen a script. He made the pilot episode, \"Spy Catcher\", which impressed Paramount, and the Nine Network immediately bought the local rights. The first episode aired in Sydney on 8 August 1971, and the rest of Australia on 26 August 1971. It was originally intended to produce 26 episodes, but following the success of the first series, Mirams held talks with both Nine Network and Paramount Pictures, who backed him for a second series. In all 42 episodes were produced. The series was last aired on Australian television in Adelaide on 21 September 1976, but has been re-run several times since.","original_name":"Spyforce","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Spyforce","cert":"Unavailable","id":14813,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18],"origin_country":["AU"]},{"first_air_date":"2007-10-14","cast":["Kim Kardashian","Kourtney Kardashian","Khloé Kardashian","Kris Jenner","Kendall Jenner"],"overview":"A peek inside the exploits and privileged private lives of the blended Kardashian-Jenner family, including sisters Kim, Kourtney and Khloé.","original_name":"Keeping Up with the Kardashians","vote_average":4.4,"name":"Keeping Up with the Kardashians","cert":"Unavailable","id":14814,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[10764],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":"2007-11-02","cast":[],"overview":"Orangutan Island is an American documentary television series, in the style of the successful series Meerkat Manor, that blends more traditional documentary filming with dramatic narration.
