The husband, Len, is a soft-hearted, well-meaning chap who holds strong views on certain subjects and is fiercely proud of his working-class roots. But his determination to prove himself the equal of those who may consider themselves his betters often leads to confrontation and infuriates his wife, Pat. They have two children, the pre-teen Sean and the sexually-maturing Siobhan, who, at 15, is at that 'awkward age'. Living in the granny flat in their yard is Mr Bebbington, who had been Len's late mother's boyfriend but has remained with them for six months since her death. Pat constantly cajoles Len into getting Bebbington out but he is quite content to let him stay and treats him as one of the family. Len's brother, Morris, who lives nearby, is a spiritual man who comes across as half-hippy and half-witted.","original_name":"Once Upon A Time In The North","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Once Upon A Time In The North","cert":"Unavailable","id":26940,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[35],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":["Rashida Jones","Shane McRae","Rachel Blanchard","Peter Serafinowicz"],"overview":"","original_name":"Our Thirties","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Our Thirties","cert":"Unavailable","id":26941,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Teliffant","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Teliffant","cert":"Unavailable","id":26952,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":"2005-11-14","cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"One for All","vote_average":0.0,"name":"One for All","cert":"Unavailable","id":26953,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["UA"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Bagatelle","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Bagatelle","cert":"Unavailable","id":26954,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["CA"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Tell The Truth","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Tell The Truth","cert":"Unavailable","id":26955,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Win Beadle's Money","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Win Beadle's Money","cert":"Unavailable","id":26956,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"The Yarns Of Billy Borker","vote_average":0.0,"name":"The Yarns Of Billy Borker","cert":"Unavailable","id":26957,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["AU"]},{"first_air_date":"2006-04-01","cast":["Junko Shimakata","Yuki Masuda"],"overview":"","original_name":"Soul Link","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Soul Link","cert":"Unavailable","id":26968,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[16],"origin_country":["JP"]},{"first_air_date":"1966-01-07","cast":["Mal Sondock"],"overview":"","original_name":"Beat!
