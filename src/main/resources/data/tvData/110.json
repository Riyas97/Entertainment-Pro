Against the odds, Ewan and his team deliver vaccines to the world's most remote children as health workers do every day. But their fragile nature means the vaccines must be kept constantly cold as they are passed along the supply chain, from freezer to freezer - wherever that may be. The routes these vaccines travel are known as cold chains, and a vast network of them exists across the globe. In this series Ewan is following three of the world's toughest cold chains, supported by Unicef, who immunise over half of the world's children. In the second episode, Ewan journeys up the mighty Congo River, where he passes through frontier towns in the wilds of Central Africa, encounters a unique subculture for whom style is a religion, and ventures deep into the jungle in search of Pygmy tribes. These two programmes give Ewan an opportunity to go to three very different countries, three situations, and find out just how much it takes to save children's lives. Ewan said of his experience: 'The cold chain routes these vaccines follow can be hugely challenging and adventurous, and I was keen to explore some of them to discover how they reach the world's most remote children.","original_name":"Ewan McGregor: Cold Chain Mission","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Ewan McGregor: Cold Chain Mission","cert":"Unavailable","id":54980,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[99],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Hitmakers was a Scandinavian reality television program for music competition which aired on Swedish Kanal 5 television channel in Spring 2008 with the premiere broadcast on Sunday, April 6, 2008.

Judges came from various record companies in the three countries. Lesser-known artists presented their own composition on condition that they have not been released yet on an album and they would get answers within a few weeks whether the song presented had any hit appeal, with a potential release of the song by one of the represented record companies.\n\nThousands of songs were presented for screening to a selection committee. When a song has been put through, they get an audience in front of the five professional jusdges. If the song gets no offers, it is eliminated. If a song gets just one offer, it is reserved for use by that record label. When more than one representative picks a particular song, a bid is initiated with the higher bidder getting to sign the artist concerned.","original_name":"Hitmakers","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Hitmakers","cert":"Unavailable","id":54981,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":"1984-01-21","cast":["Lasse Åberg","Ole Söderblom","Pia Green","Sven Melander","Magnus Härenstam"],"overview":"","original_name":"Zvampen","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Zvampen","cert":"Unavailable","id":54982,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[35,10751,10762],"origin_country":["SE"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Trazan & Banarne was a Swedish children's television series which was broadcast first in late 1970s\/early 1980s, 1st time was as \"Jullovsmorgon\" 1976\/1977, in Sveriges Television.
