Both series, however failed in the ratings against ABC's The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin.\n\nAfter the initial Friday airing, viewers could still find the series on CBS Saturdays at 7 p.m. Eastern during March 1957, on Sundays at 6 p.m. from April to May 1957, and on Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m. from June to August 1957. NBC carried the program in color at 6:30 p.m. Sunday from September to December 1957 and at 7 p.m. Sunday from January to May 1958. In subsequent years, the series aired mostly on Saturday mornings on all networks. The Disney Channel ran it on Monday evenings in the mid-1980s. Over the years many viewers were unaware that the series produced episodes for only a single season.\n\nMy Friend Flicka starred native Canadian Johnny Washbrook as Ken McLaughlin, a boy devoted to his horse Flicka, Swedish for \"little girl\", but actually an Arabian sorrel named Wahana. Gene Evans played the authoritarian father Rob McLaughlin, a former U.S. Army cavalry officer. Anita Louise was cast as the gentle-spirited mother, Nell. Frank Ferguson portrayed Gus Broeberg, the loyal ranch hand. Flicka is based on a novel by Mary O'Hara, written at the Remount Ranch, located between Laramie and Cheyenne, Wyoming. Some Internet sites say that the series is set in Montana, where some of the filming was done. The majority of the filming, however, was at Fox Movie Ranch. My Friend Flicka holds the distinction of having been the first television series filmed by 20th Century Fox.

The series is done in the style of film noir and combines the feel of a detective show with the mecha genre of anime. The setpieces are reminiscent of Toho kaiju movies and the score is an eclectic mix of styles and musical homages.\n\nThe Big O premiered 13 October 1999 on WOWOW satellite television. It finished its run on 19 January 2000. The English-language version premiered on Cartoon Network on 2 April 2001 and ended on 18 April 2001. Originally a 26 episode series, low viewership in Japan cut it down to the just first 13. However, positive fan response internationally resulted in a second season co-produced by Cartoon Network, Sunrise, and Bandai Visual consisting of the remaining 13 episodes. Season two premiered on Japan's SUN-TV on January 2003, with the American premiere taking place seven months later. Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment in 2012, Sunrise had announced at Otakon 2013, that both seasons of The Big O along with a handful of former BEI titles would be rescued by Sentai Filmworks.","original_name":"The ビッグオー","vote_average":7.7,"name":"The Big O","cert":"Unavailable","id":18241,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[16,18,10759],"origin_country":["JP"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"The Flying Fox of Snowy Mountain is a Hong Kong television series adapted from Louis Cha's novels Flying Fox of Snowy Mountain and Other Tales of the Flying Fox.
