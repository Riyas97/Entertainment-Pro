She also had a basketball coach husband named Kevin Hunter who served as the patriarch of the family. Together, they raised a 7-year-old daughter Tess and a toddler son named Griffin. During the entire run of the series, a simple electric guitar instrumental solo was used as the show's opening theme. Laugh tracks were used in all episodes in the sitcom as it was filmed \"live before a studio audience.\"\n\nDuring the 1990s, it was common to give stand-up comedians their own sitcom on TV; even if their first one had flopped. Lisa Ann Walter was a stand-up comedian who played a mouthy feminist who could stand up to her mother in addition to her superiors at work. While Lisa Ann's character had plenty of zingers to her, there was still a sense of \"been-there-done-that\" with her character.\n\nIn one of the episodes, Lisa Ann claimed to have a sexual affair with then-current American President Bill Clinton.","original_name":"Life's Work","vote_average":6.0,"name":"Life's Work","cert":"Unavailable","id":10277,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[35],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":"1976-01-30","cast":[],"overview":"Live From Lincoln Center is an ongoing series of musical performances produced by Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in conjunction with Thirteen\/WNET in New York City.\n\nA series of concerts, ballets, operas, and recitals telecast, as the title says, live from Lincoln Center, it was created and developed by Executive Producer John Goberman and premiered on January 30, 1976 with a concert featuring André Previn and Van Cliburn.

The quick-cutting, free-association, stream-of-consciousness style of the show caused Chapin, years later on a talk show, to describe Make a Wish as \"a show for six-year old speed freaks.\"\n\nThe series won a Peabody Award for Best Children's Series in 1971.\n\nSome songs performed on the show were written by Tom's brother, Harry Chapin.
