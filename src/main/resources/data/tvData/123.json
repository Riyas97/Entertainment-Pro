All assassination teams faced one big problem: getting close enough to kill. No one in the ancient world had sniper rifles. As a result even the most formidable Japanese Ninjas got captured and tortured.\n\nThis series brings some of the most dramatic tales of antiquity to life with a mixture of dramatic reconstruction, documentary filming and expert testimony.\n\nEach episode details the intricate complexity of the elite troops who performed the assassination missions and how they worked. It shows what they had to do to achieve elite status, how they could dress, and the weapons they got to use when they completed their first mission.","original_name":"Ancient Black Ops","vote_average":6.0,"name":"Ancient Black Ops","cert":"Unavailable","id":61476,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[99],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":"2014-08-29","cast":["Wongsakorn Poramathakorn","Ausadaporn Siriwattanakul","Likit Butprom","Ornlene Sothiwanwongse","Jayjintai Untimanon"],"overview":"The story of a young composer and only child with the painful truth that Chirayu her fiance may be having a relationship with another.
