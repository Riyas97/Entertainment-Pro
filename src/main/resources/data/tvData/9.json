The show starred Michael Praed and Jason Connery as two different incarnations of the title character. Unlike previous adaptations of the Robin Hood legend, Robin of Sherwood combined a gritty, authentic production design with elements of real-life history, 20th century fiction, and pagan myth. The series is also notable for its haunting title music by Clannad, which won a BAFTA award.","original_name":"Robin of Sherwood","vote_average":8.1,"name":"Robin of Sherwood","cert":"Unavailable","id":4488,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[10765,18,10759],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":"1970-09-12","cast":["Casey Kasem","Don Messick","Janet Waldo","Jerry Dexter","Sherry Alberoni"],"overview":"Josie and the Pussycats is an American animated television series, based upon the Archie Comics comic book series of the same name created by Dan DeCarlo. Produced for Saturday morning television by Hanna-Barbera Productions, sixteen episodes of Josie and the Pussycats aired on CBS during the 1970-71 television season, and were rerun during the 1971-72 season. In 1972, the show was re-conceptualized as Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space, sixteen episodes of which aired on CBS during the 1972-73 season and were rerun the following season. Reruns of the original series alternated between CBS, ABC, and NBC from 1974 through 1976. This brought its national Saturday morning TV run on three networks to six years.\n\nJosie and the Pussycats featured an all-girl pop music band that toured the world with their entourage, getting mixed up in strange adventures, spy capers, and mysteries. On the small-screen, the group consisted of level-headed lead singer and guitarist Josie, intelligent tambourinist Valerie, and air-headed blonde drummer Melody. Other characters included their cowardly manager Alexander Cabot III, his conniving sister Alexandra, her cat Sebastian, and muscular roadie Alan.","original_name":"Josie and the Pussycats","vote_average":5.9,"name":"Josie and the Pussycats","cert":"Unavailable","id":4489,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[16,10762],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"The World Game is an Australian football television show broadcast on SBS.

Meet the Press is the highest-rated of the American television Sunday morning talk shows.\n\nIt has been hosted by 11 moderators, beginning with Martha Rountree. The current host is David Gregory, who assumed the role in December 2008. The show began using a new set on May 2, 2010, with video screens and a library-style set with bookshelves, and different, modified intro music, with David Gregory previewing the guests using a large video screen, and with the Meet the Press theme music in a shorter \"modernized [style]... the beginning repeated with drum beats\". Meet the Press and similar shows specialize in interviewing national leaders on issues of politics, economics, foreign policy and other public affairs.\n\nOver the past few years, the program's usual time slot over the NBC network is between 9-10 a.m. local time in most markets, though this may vary by markets due to commitments by affiliates to religious, E\/I or local news and public affairs programming. It also varies several weeks in the summer due to morning coverage of French Open tennis or the Monaco Grand Prix by NBC Sports. In earlier years, the program would air at noon every Sunday. The program also re-airs Sunday afternoons at 2 p.m. ET and early Monday mornings at 4 a.m. ET on MSNBC, along with an early Monday morning replay as part of NBC's \"All Night\" lineup. The program is also distributed to radio stations via syndication by Dial Global, and aired as part of C-SPAN Radio's replay of the Sunday morning talk shows.","original_name":"Meet the Press","vote_average":4.6,"name":"Meet the Press","cert":"Unavailable","id":4496,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[10763],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Fixing Dinner is a Canadian food reality television series on Food Network Canada, airing on AmericanLife in the United States.
