Hosted by Charlton Heston, the program argued that mankind has lived on the Earth for tens of millions of years, and that mainstream scientists have suppressed the fossil evidence for this. Some material included was based on the controversial Forbidden Archeology, a book written by Hindu creationists Michael Cremo and Richard L. Thompson about anomalous archeological finds reported mainly in early scientific journals. It also included interviews with the following people: creationist Carl Baugh on the Paluxy tracks; Richard Milton, author of Shattering the Myths of Darwinism, on Lucy; Neil Steede on Incan ruins; and Graham Hancock, author of Fingerprints of the Gods, on Atlantis. It was produced by B. C. Video Inc.\n\nThe program was widely criticized by the scientific community. Donald Johanson said it was \"absolutely shameful, and it sort of sets us back 100 years\". Jim Foley of TalkOrigins called it a \"pseudo-scientific mishmash of discredited claims and crackpot ideas\". However, the criticism did not prevent NBC from re-broadcasting the special on June 8, 1996. In response, John Carman wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle, \"You'd think the NBC brass would be a touch embarrassed by the program, and eager to let the little furor fritter away into oblivion. But then you really would be a simpleton. NBC, a subsidiary of the science giant General Electric, does not exist to sharpen minds. Science, schmience. If there was money to be made from it, NBC would tell you the Earth is flat because of repeated indentations from space aliens on pogo sticks.\" Dave Thomas wrote in Skeptical Briefs that \"quality science was nowhere to be found\" in the program, as it had people of questionable credentials interviewed and failed to interview the leading researchers in their respective fields.

It premiered in Sweden on Sveriges Television in January 2009, and the first guests to appear on the show were former Prime Minister of Sweden Göran Persson and his wife Anitra Steen. On 8 May 2009, it was announced that Skavlan had been renewed for a second season. It was also announced that the show would no longer only be produced by SVT in Sweden; Skavlan would now be partly produced in Norway by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. The first twelve episodes of Skavlan's second season were produced by SVT in Sweden, and the remaining twelve by NRK in Norway.\n\nSkavlan speaks Norwegian and his dialog is therefore subtitled in Swedish in Sweden, even though the two languages are quite similar and mutually intelligible. If the persons being interviewed by Skavlan are Swedish, he often tells them to let him know if they do not understand what he is saying. Swedish novelist Jan Guillou has criticized SVT for subtitling the program, stating \"there is no need for that. If the host had been Danish, subtitling would have been necessary, but with a Norwegian host it does not make any sense.\"","original_name":"Skavlan","vote_average":4.1,"name":"Skavlan","cert":"Unavailable","id":31449,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[10767],"origin_country":["SE","NO"]},{"first_air_date":"1999-07-19","cast":["Lisette Morelos","Eduardo Verástegui","Karla Álvarez","Ariel López Padilla","Arleth Terán"],"overview":"Alma Rebelde is a 1999 Mexican telenovela, starring Lisette Morelos, Eduardo Verástegui and the late Edgar Ponce.
