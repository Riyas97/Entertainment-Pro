was an Australian television comedy game show. In Sydney it aired on station ATN-7, while in Melbourne it aired on GTV-9. The half-hour show was hosted Bob Dyer, who had previously hosted a version for radio on the Macquarie Radio Network.\n\nA discription in a 1957 edition of The Age newspaper said the television series \"puts contestants though amusing situations with worth-while prizes as their reward\", According to a different edition of The Age, one of these \"situations\" was having the contestant attempt to milk a cow\n\nIn one television episode, Jack Davey appeared and gave Dyer a meringue pie in the face, and then \"kissed\" him\n\nIn another episode, a contestant named Mr. Martin had a water balloon poised above his head, while his wife tried to figure out what a man named Steve Petrovich was doing by pantomime. Failure to determine this would result in Mr. Martin having the water balloon dropped on him\n\nAlthough kinescope recordings were likely made to allow the series to air on both stations, it is not known if any of these recordings of the television version still exist, and there is the possibility the series may be lost.

It was first aired by the BBC over two series in 1995 and 1996. It was described by series script editor Claire Elliot as \"contemporary, gritty, urban reality\".\n\nShot on film, its tight script, fast-paced direction and strong cast made for powerful and compulsive viewing. The program gained great reviews but low ratings. Viewers at the time seemed uncomfortable with the hand-held camera work and bleak Yorkshire backdrop. This was no 'Heartbeat', but instead Brazen Gate Police Station was an over-stretched service dealing with the dregs of society. More of an ensemble piece than a star vehicle because writers Bill Gallagher and Peter Bowker were more interested in character development over plot. However the series did not shy away from strong topics including male rape and euthanasia. John Hannah, fresh from the success of Four Weddings and a Funeral, was the most well known face in the show and his character DS Frankie Driscoll was regarded as a tough thief taker who finds his career threatened when he suffers a mild stroke in which battle to hid from his fellow officers. The light relief came from the excellent Neil Dudgeon who as DC Marty Brazil became more and more angry as each week passed as his disillusionment set in. In the second season David Morrissey came in for Hannah before Out of the Blue ended its run.","original_name":"Out of the Blue (UK)","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Out of the Blue (UK)","cert":"Unavailable","id":23278,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[80,18],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":"2014-07-19","cast":["Ruby Lin","Weber Yang","Tiffany Hsu","Melvin Sia","Jason Tsou"],"overview":"the story tells of how a group of friends come together, encounter love and many other aspects of life through major events that occurred during 16 summers, such as the 729 blackout, 921 earthquake, SARS and the Beijing Olympics9","original_name":"16個夏天","vote_average":0.0,"name":"The Way We Were","cert":"Unavailable","id":23279,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18,35],"origin_country":["TW"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"The Road Show","vote_average":0.0,"name":"The Road Show","cert":"Unavailable","id":23280,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Wildcat","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Wildcat","cert":"Unavailable","id":23281,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["CA"]},{"first_air_date":"2004-04-03","cast":["Junko Noda","Aya Hirayama","Hikaru Tokida","Tomoyuki Shimura","Masahito Yabe"],"overview":"","original_name":"ダンドー","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Dan Doh!!","cert":"Unavailable","id":23282,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[16],"origin_country":["JP"]},{"first_air_date":"1991-02-17","cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Cool Head","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Cool Head","cert":"Unavailable","id":23285,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[35],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":"1974-10-31","cast":["Victor Borge"],"overview":"","original_name":"The Complete Victor Borge","vote_average":0.0,"name":"The Complete Victor Borge","cert":"Unavailable","id":23286,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Here's Howard","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Here's Howard","cert":"Unavailable","id":23287,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Our Kid","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Our Kid","cert":"Unavailable","id":23288,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":"1965-09-08","cast":["Roy Kinnear"],"overview":"","original_name":"A Slight Case Of...","vote_average":0.0,"name":"A Slight Case Of...","cert":"Unavailable","id":23289,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":"1991-05-04","cast":["Charlie Condou","Nicholas Woodeson","Janet Dale"],"overview":"","original_name":"The Wolvis Family","vote_average":0.0,"name":"The Wolvis Family","cert":"Unavailable","id":23290,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":"2005-03-27","cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"The Queen's Castle","vote_average":0.0,"name":"The Queen's Castle","cert":"Unavailable","id":23291,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":"2001-04-23","cast":["Jillian Reynolds","Jillian Barberie"],"overview":"","original_name":"The Test","vote_average":0.0,"name":"The Test","cert":"Unavailable","id":23292,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Hometown","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Hometown","cert":"Unavailable","id":23293,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["CA"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Our Secret Weapon: The Truth was a public affairs program broadcast on the DuMont Television Network from October 22, 1950 to April 17, 1951 and hosted by conservative commentators Leo Cherne and Ralph de Toledano.","original_name":"Our Secret Weapon: The Truth","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Our Secret Weapon: The Truth","cert":"Unavailable","id":23294,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":"2006-04-14","cast":["Miranda Richardson","John Reardon","Meghan Ory","Andrew Jackson","Sam Neill"],"overview":"Merlin's Apprentice is a British miniseries that aired on Channel 4 in 2006.

The series aired on CBS from 1955 to 1966. The series was credited with popularizing the Mighty Mouse character in popular culture far beyond what the original film shorts had done.\n\nMighty Mouse was not extraordinarily popular in theatrical cartoons, but was still Terrytoons' most popular character. What made him a cultural icon was television. Most of the short film studios, both live-action and animated, were in decline by the 1950s, pressured both by the loss of film audiences to television as well as the increased popularity of low-budget, stylized, limited animation. Most of the studios cashed out of the short-film production business and began licensing or selling their back catalogs to television. Paul Terry went as far as to sell the entire Terrytoon company to CBS in 1955. The network began running Mighty Mouse Playhouse in December 1955. It remained on the air for nearly twelve years. Mighty Mouse cartoons became a staple of children's television programming for a period of over thirty years, from the 1950s through the 1980s.","original_name":"Mighty Mouse Playhouse","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Mighty Mouse Playhouse","cert":"Unavailable","id":23466,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[16],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":"1989-04-10","cast":["Caroline McWilliams","Stuart Pankin","Wendy Schaal","Eric Idle","Henderson Forsythe"],"overview":"Nearly Departed is an American sitcom that aired on NBC on Monday nights from April 10, 1989 to May 1, 1989.","original_name":"Nearly Departed","vote_average":6.0,"name":"Nearly Departed","cert":"Unavailable","id":23467,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[10765,35],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":"2000-10-28","cast":["Kenneth Welsh","Matt Frewer"],"overview":"","original_name":"Sherlock Holmes (CA)","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Sherlock Holmes (CA)","cert":"Unavailable","id":23468,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["CA"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"The Great Domestic Showdown","vote_average":0.0,"name":"The Great Domestic Showdown","cert":"Unavailable","id":23469,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":"1954-11-01","cast":["Irving Fields","Ilona Massey"],"overview":"The Ilona Massey Show was a DuMont Television Network variety show hosted by actress Ilona Massey and featuring musician Irving Fields.
