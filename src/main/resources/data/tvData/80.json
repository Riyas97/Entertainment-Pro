The strand showcased feature-length, middle-brow single plays on Saturday evenings for more than 50 years, having been launched in April 1943. The plays featured in the strand included stage plays, books adaptations and original dramatisations. For most of its history, programmes ran for 90 minutes and were largely entertainment centred, such as thrillers, comedies and mysteries.\n\nSaturday Night Theatre was noted as the major drama of the week on BBC Radio 4, until it was scrapped as a programme strand in 1996. Shorter plays continued to be broadcast on Radio 4 on Saturday evenings from 1996 until the relaunch of the channel's schedule in April 1998 by James Boyle, when single dramas were removed from the Saturday evening schedule. Since 1998, the main weekly play on the station has been The Saturday Play, a daytime programme that runs for 60\u201390 minutes.\n\nThere have since been campaigns to bring back Saturday Night Theatre, but in the context of BBC budget cuts, that have included the 2010 axing of Radio 4's Friday Play, any return looks unlikely.","original_name":"Saturday Night Theatre","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Saturday Night Theatre","cert":"Unavailable","id":39988,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Every Woman Knows a Secret","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Every Woman Knows a Secret","cert":"Unavailable","id":39991,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Coming Up","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Coming Up","cert":"Unavailable","id":39994,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"cert":"Unavailable","cast":["Devon Massyn","Myke Clarkson","James Milner"],"id":39995,"first_air_date":"2010-08-08","overview":"The Speed of Life is a brand new series, specializing in high speed photography to capture the amazing, blazing fast intricacies of daily life for animals and insects on the planet.
