Wrenching first-person narratives from seven decades of women, each one facing an unplanned pregnancy -- and the dreadful decision that no one wants to make. Both pro-life and pro-choice, both out front on the picket line and inside the clinic, these women's stories turn politics into heart-searing drama: a pregnant 17-year-old and her pro-life mother whose conflict unfolds in front of the camera; a 22-year-old who became a pro-life protester when she learned that her mother nearly aborted her; an unhappy mother-of-two who's expecting a third when her marriage suddenly hits the rocks; a 71-year-old grandmother who still grieves for her mother, an early victim of illegal abortion. In this fusion of past and present, the history of abortion is the history of women -- told at a time in America when yesterday's back-alley abortions may be the only choice left for tomorrow.","original_name":"Abortion: Desperate Choices","vote_average":6.0,"name":"Abortion: Desperate Choices","cert":"Unavailable","id":47354,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":"1991-02-03","cast":["Gary Cole","Rosanna Arquette","Stanley Anderson","Edward Blatchford","George Dickerson"],"overview":"The story of George Custer, Crazy Horse and the events prior to the battle of the Little Bighorn, told from the different perspectives of two women.","original_name":"Son of the Morning Star","vote_average":7.0,"name":"Son of the Morning Star","cert":"Unavailable","id":47357,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18],"origin_country":["AE"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"George Carlin: Jammin' in New York","vote_average":9.0,"name":"George Carlin: Jammin' in New York","cert":"Unavailable","id":47366,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"The Winter of Our Discontent is a 1983 made-for-TV movie directed by Waris Hussein based on the novel of the same name by John Steinbeck.","original_name":"The Winter of Our Discontent","vote_average":9.0,"name":"The Winter of Our Discontent","cert":"Unavailable","id":47367,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Something About Amelia is a 1984 TV movie exploring the trauma to a family caused by incest.\n\nThe film starred Ted Danson, Glenn Close, Missy Francis and Roxana Zal.

The film makes significant deviations from James O'Donnell's book, published in 1975. The deviations are mainly due to an effort to clarify the events and allow the actors license to interpret some of the dialogue he recorded. The film opens in 1945, with O'Donnell's gaining entry to the Führerbunker by bribing a Russian sentry with a pack of cigarettes.\n\nThe most noteworthy legacy of the film was Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Adolf Hitler, for which he won an Emmy. Actors on the set claimed his performance was so good that those playing German soldiers snapped to attention whenever Hopkins came onto the set, even if he wasn't in character.\n\nThe actors' interpretations of the events differ in ways from the traditional accounts. For example, during the final meeting between Hitler and Albert Speer, Hopkins adopts a sarcastic tone and gestures that suggest that Hitler was already aware of Speer's betrayal, even though he uses the exact words recounted by the witnesses. This became a fairly controversial scene due to a perception in some circles that the resemblance to Jesus Christ's legendary foreseeing of Judas's betrayal was intentional. These accusations were consistently denied, as were reports regarding a rumored on-set romance between Piper Laurie and Cliff Gorman.","original_name":"The Bunker","vote_average":7.9,"name":"The Bunker","cert":"Unavailable","id":47382,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Crisis at Central High was a 1981 made-for-television movie about the Little Rock Integration Crisis of 1957, based on a draft of the memoir by the same name by former assistant principal Elizabeth Huckaby.\n\nWilliam Link and Richard Levinson wrote the screenplay and were executive producers together with David Susskind of Time-Life Productions.
