Sutherland, Caine and Shaw were, at the time, almost completely unknown to American audiences, and just before the presentation's first U.S. telecast, Plummer began to gain popularity in the U.S. because of his appearance in the 1965 musical film The Sound of Music.","original_name":"Hamlet at Elsinore","vote_average":7.0,"name":"Hamlet at Elsinore","cert":"Unavailable","id":48125,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Kraft Salutes George Burns' 90th Birthday","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Kraft Salutes George Burns' 90th Birthday","cert":"Unavailable","id":48126,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Thursday Theatre","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Thursday Theatre","cert":"Unavailable","id":48127,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"The Wars of the Roses","vote_average":8.0,"name":"The Wars of the Roses","cert":"Unavailable","id":48128,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"L'aiguille Du Midi","vote_average":0.0,"name":"L'aiguille Du Midi","cert":"Unavailable","id":48129,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"LSO - The Music Men","vote_average":0.0,"name":"LSO - The Music Men","cert":"Unavailable","id":48130,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":"2011-03-05","cast":["Natalia Keber","Jakub Jankiewicz","Piotr Tołoczko","Katarzyna Tlałka","Marta Żmuda-Trzebiatowska"],"overview":"","original_name":"Chichot losu","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Chichot losu","cert":"Unavailable","id":48131,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18],"origin_country":["PL"]},{"first_air_date":"2009-04-25","cast":["Mac Kelly","Adam Showers","Nina Kircher","Mark Knote","Steve Czapiewski"],"overview":"Wolfman Mac's Chiller Drive-In is a \"horror host\" series hosted by \"Wolfman\" Mac Kelly, which currently airs Saturday nights at 10 pm on the Retro Television Network.

Monitor ranged in subject over all the arts.\n\nThe hundredth programme was a film directed by Ken Russell and written by Wheldon, the celebrated Elgar. The Elgar film was innovative because it was the first time that an arts programme showed one long film about an artistic figure instead of short items, and also it was the first time that re-enactments were used. Prior to this, only photos or location shots had been used in programmes. Russell however still met resistance from Wheldon in allowing actors to play the subjects of his films. The Elgar film includes sequences of the young composer riding his bicycle on the Malvern Hills accompanied by Elgar's Introduction & Allegro for Strings. Russell had a particular empathy with Elgar's music because, like the composer, he was a Catholic.\n\nWheldon's Monitor lasted until he had \"interviewed everyone I am interested in interviewing\", and he was succeeded by Jonathan Miller for the series' last season.","original_name":"Monitor","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Monitor","cert":"Unavailable","id":48159,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":"2012-03-04","cast":["Michał Mikołajczak","Agnieszka Dygant","Leszek Lichota","Daria Widawska","Małgorzata Kożuchowska"],"overview":"True Law is a Polish legal drama television series directed by Maciej Migas and featuring Agnieszka Dygant as the title character, Agata Przybysz.
