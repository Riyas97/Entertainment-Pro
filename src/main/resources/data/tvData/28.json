Out of the original six participants, four of them left the show and were replaced by other willing students, chosen by a public telephone vote.

Set in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War, it is regarded as an accurate depiction of army life in the early to mid-1990s, when the British Army was undergoing significant change. This is perhaps best demonstrated during the third series, around 1994, when a significant number of real regiments were forced into amalgamations with each other due to downsizing of the army. In the world of Soldier Soldier, the King's Fusiliers are also forced to amalgamate with the Cumbrian Regiment, another fictional regiment, becoming the King's Own Fusiliers. At the time Soldier Soldier was broadcast, the fatality rate was low with most casualties due to training accidents and suicides. The military as a whole was assigned to performing more peacekeeping missions than actually doing any fighting. As a consequence, the show served well to portray the army, despite the domestic problems that could occur, in a fairly good light.","original_name":"Soldier Soldier","vote_average":5.7,"name":"Soldier Soldier","cert":"Unavailable","id":13587,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":"1953-10-02","cast":["Charles Collingwood","Edward R.

The series was originally developed under the title of Hackett by producer Graham Williams, but he was then asked to swap roles with the outgoing producer of Doctor Who, Philip Hinchcliffe who retitled the show Target. It starred Patrick Mower as Det. Supt. Steve Hackett, Brendan Price as Det. Sgt. Frank Bonney, Vivien Heilbron as Det. Sgt. Louise Colbert and Philip Madoc as Det. Chief Supt. Tate. Seventeen episodes were produced over two series. The show was the BBC response to ITV's highly successful series The Sweeney. Like The Sweeney the cars used were Fords, mostly Cortinas and Granadas; however Hackett's personal car is American along the lines of a Dodge Charger and is seen in a number of episodes. There is a distinct lack of humour compared to the Sweeney and at the time the series was slated as being more violent than The Sweeney, though watching this now it is hard to tell the difference. The second series was toned down. Also Patrick Mower being such a strong actor seems to overpower the supporting cast, something that was not evident in the Sweeney. The theme music was by Dudley Simpson. Each episode lasted approx 50mins. A third series was mooted with Robert Banks Stewart taking over as producer. He spent two weeks in the producer's chair, during which he planned to change the supporting cast, bring down the violence and steer the show further away from The Sweeney. However, he has then informed by the head of drama that the series was being scrapped and asked to come up with a replacement crime series.

The three Rangers were curly-haired Rod Brown, prickly Frank Boyd and obese Wilber Wormser. Their immediate superior was Commander Swift. Director George Gould had also been the director of ABC's Tom Corbett from 1950 to 1952, and he carried with him to CBS several of the writers for that pioneering series, plus its basic concepts, plus the major special effect, an amplifier producing travelling mattes. The very close similarity between Rod Brown and Tom Corbett generated at least one lawsuit, which seems to have resulted in the Rod Brown kinescopes never being rebroadcast.\n\nRod Brown's adventures had a sponsor, Jell-O Instant Pudding. However, there are very few premiums or toys associated with the series, as compared to its rival live space adventure series such as Captain Video, Space Patrol, and Tom Corbett, Space Cadet.

Created by Simon Cowell, the show began in September 2004 and has since aired annually from August\/September through to December. The show is produced by FremantleMedia's Thames and Cowell's production company SYCOtv. It is broadcast on the ITV network in the United Kingdom and TV3 in Ireland, with spin-off behind-the-scenes show The Xtra Factor screened on ITV2. It is the originator of the international The X Factor franchise. The X Factor was devised as a replacement for the highly successful Pop Idol, which was put on indefinite hiatus after its second series, largely because Cowell, who was a judge on Pop Idol, wished to launch a show to which he owned the television rights. The perceived similarity between the two shows later became the subject of a legal dispute. The \"X Factor\" of the title refers to the undefinable \"something\" that makes for star quality.\n\nThe original judging panel was Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh. Dannii Minogue joined the panel in series 4, and Cheryl Cole replaced Osbourne in series 5 after her departure. After series 7, Cowell and Cole both left to judge the American version of the show whilst Minogue left the show due to commitments on Australia's Got Talent. Kelly Rowland, Tulisa Contostavlos and Gary Barlow then joined Walsh on the judging panel for series 8, though Rowland announced she would not return for series 9 and was replaced by Nicole Scherzinger. Osbourne later returned in 2013, replacing Contostavlos. Since 2007, the show has been presented by Dermot O'Leary, who replaced original host Kate Thornton. The show is split into a series of phases, following the contestants from auditions through to the grand finale. In the original televised audition phase of the show, contestants sang in an audition room in front of just the judges. From series 6 onwards, auditionees sing on a stage in front of the judges and a live audience. Successful auditionees go through to \"bootcamp\" and then to \"judges' houses\", where judges narrow down the acts in their category down to three or four acts to mentor for the live shows, where the public vote for their favourite acts following weekly live performances by the contestants.","genre_ids":[10764],"origin_country":["GB"],"original_name":"The X Factor","vote_average":4.5,"name":"The X Factor","adult":"false"}]
