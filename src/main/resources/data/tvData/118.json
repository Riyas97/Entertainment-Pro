The series had to face large controversy due to its depiction of Omar, Abu Bakr, Osman and Ali, the four Rashidun Caliphs, along with other characters, who some Muslims believe should not be depicted much like the Prophet Mohammad. The series consisted of 30 episodes and was originally aired in the month of Ramadan since July 20, 2012. It was made at a cost of 200 million Saudi Riyals and filmed in Morocco, mostly in Marakesh, Tangiers, El Jadida, Casablanca and Mohammedia. After the series was broadcast on MBC, dubbed into several languages and subtitled in English on youtube, it received great support from many different scholarly bodies and people watching it. As the series depended solely on reliable historical established facts, the series did not face criticism in terms of its content, as past movies and films faced.","original_name":"Omar","vote_average":10.0,"name":"Omar","cert":"Unavailable","id":58887,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[99,18],"origin_country":["QA"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Hero of the Day","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Hero of the Day","cert":"Unavailable","id":58888,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["RU"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"The Canadian Farmer is a Canadian current affairs television miniseries which aired on CBC Television in 1959.","original_name":"The Canadian Farmer","vote_average":0.0,"name":"The Canadian Farmer","cert":"Unavailable","id":58889,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Prickly Heat was a British game show broadcast on Sky One from 1998 to 2001.","original_name":"Prickly Heat","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Prickly Heat","cert":"Unavailable","id":58890,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"After The Deluge: The Valley","vote_average":0.0,"name":"After The Deluge: The Valley","cert":"Unavailable","id":58891,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"","original_name":"Outback Fight Club","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Outback Fight Club","cert":"Unavailable","id":58898,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Guerra de mujeres is a telenovela produced by Venevisión in 2001.
