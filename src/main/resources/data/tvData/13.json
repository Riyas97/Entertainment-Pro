JCW currently runs shows throughout the country. The video games Backyard Wrestling: Don't Try This at Home and Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood feature numerous independent wrestlers from the promotion.\n\nThe style of JCW is largely based upon hardcore wrestling. Bruce and Utsler refer to Extreme Championship Wrestling as the major influence on the company's style as well as their unique camera angles, which they compare to that of the movie Natural Born Killers; \"fading in and out, and turning all over.\" In early years of the company, talent mostly consisted of rappers and well-known names performing under parody alternate-names. The company instituted a change in the roster after changing their name, focusing more on independent and hardcore wrestlers, as well as several established names.\n\nJCW records the majority of its shows and releases them in episodes of SlamTV! and on DVDs, which are sold on its online store. It launched the JCW Wrestling School with Kevin Canady as head trainer in 2010. That December, the promotion began running bi-weekly events at The Modern Exchange in Southgate, Michigan and established a video distributing partnership with HighSpots.com. In March 2011, it launched a broadcasting website and began showing its bi-weekly events live on internet pay-per-view.","original_name":"Juggalo Championship Wrestling","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Juggalo Championship Wrestling","cert":"Unavailable","id":6199,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":"1972-12-25","cast":["Iain Cuthbertson","Michael Bates","Jane Asher","Michael Bryant"],"overview":"The Stone Tape is a television play directed by Peter Sasdy and starring Michael Bryant, Jane Asher, Michael Bates and Iain Cuthbertson. It was broadcast on BBC Two as a Christmas ghost story in 1972. Combining aspects of science fiction and horror, the story concerns a team of scientists who move into their new research facility, a renovated Victorian mansion that has a reputation for being haunted. The team investigate the phenomena, trying to determine if the stones of the building are acting as a recording medium for past events. However, their investigations serve only to unleash a darker, more malevolent force.\n\nThe Stone Tape was written by Nigel Kneale, best known as the writer of Quatermass. Its juxtaposition of science and superstition is a frequent theme in Kneale's work; in particular, his 1952 radio play You Must Listen, about a haunted telephone line, is a notable antecedent of The Stone Tape. The play was also inspired by a visit Kneale had paid to the BBC's research and development department, which is located in an old Victorian house in Kingswood, Surrey. Critically acclaimed at time of broadcast, it remains well regarded to this day as one of Nigel Kneale's best and most terrifying plays. Since its broadcast, the hypothesis of residual haunting \u2013 that ghosts are recordings of past events made by the natural environment \u2013 has come to be known as the \"Stone Tape Theory\".","original_name":"The Stone Tape","vote_average":7.0,"name":"The Stone Tape","cert":"Unavailable","id":6214,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Our World was the first live, international, satellite television production, which was broadcast on 25 June 1967.

It was made for the ITV network by Thames.\n\nIt was written by and starred Hugh Dennis, Nick Hancock and Steve Punt, all previously known - though particularly, Punt and Dennis - for their work on the alternative comedy and satirical circuit, especially through the BBC Radio 1 sketch show The Mary Whitehouse Experience, which had transferred to television and made Dennis and Punt into household names.\n\nThe plot centred around Hancock's character, John Hanley, a teacher of physical education who lived happily and lazily alone in a flat in the fictional area of Southbridge, London, until his old school friend, ambitious and obnoxious businessman Harry Dunstan, returns from working in France and moves in with him. Punt's character, the unemployed but intelligent Mark Prior, lives nearby but was forever visiting the others after arguing with his parents.\n\nThe six-part series was continuous in its plot, with Harry trying to win back the affections of girlfriend Clare with whom he had declined to keep in touch while in France. The other regular characters were Hanley's upstairs neighbours Helen and Todd, a reformed but still scary ex-convict and his wife, who was his probation officer. A running theme is Harry's discomfort with Todd living above due to his prejudice against criminals, even reformed ones.","original_name":"Me, You and Him","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Me, You and Him","cert":"Unavailable","id":6481,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":"2006-08-04","cast":["Rob de Leeuw","Nicolas Wright","Trevor Hayes","James A.
