It aired Sundays on MTV in the United States, and the feature film based on the same concept was released in 2003. It stars a group of reporters with developmental disabilities who interview celebrities and politicians. It is the continuation of a documentary film project started in 1999 by Arthur Bradford at Camp Jabberwocky in Martha's Vineyard, which was made into a movie of the same name and shown on HBO in 2003. South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone serve as the show's executive producers. Season One had a total of 6 episodes.\n\nAccording to the \"How's Your News?\" website on April 9, 2009, the show has not been renewed for a second season on MTV, stating:\n\n\"The decision had little to do with the quality of the series, which was one of the most enthusiastically received and best reviewed programs on mtv this year. It\u2019s just a tough financial time and mtv needed to keep pushing for higher ratings with other shows. Also, we always knew that our series was an unusual fit for their style of programming. We\u2019re not \u201CThe Hills\u201D or \u201CAmerica\u2019s Next Best Dance Crew\u201D after all\u2026\"\n\nAfter completing the feature film for HBO, the concept was pitched to the Trio network, who subsequently backed the short film \"On the Campaign Trail\", about the How's Your News? teams trip to both the Democratic and Republican conventions in 2004. The half hour film was broadcast on Trio and Channel Four England and featured candid interviews with Hillary Clinton, John McCain, Andre 3000, Ben Affleck, Howard Dean, Michael Moore and Newt Gingrich, amongst others. Although it was rarely seen, this half hour documentary was well reviewed and helped convince MTV of the viability of the concept as mainstream TV series. They funded a pilot in 2006.","original_name":"How's Your News?","vote_average":0.0,"name":"How's Your News?","cert":"Unavailable","id":17500,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[35,10763],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":"2007-01-09","cast":[],"overview":"Biz Kid$ is an educational television show that teaches financial education and entrepreneurship to a preteen audience.

His signature outfit was a helmet and a dark uniform under a light-colored, triangular vest that had a thunderbolt passing through a globe. The set was a cutaway rocket ship called the Starfinder II that blasted off each day. Guest children would co-pilot under Captain Satellite's supervision. As the ship orbited on auto-pilot, the children would participate in games to win prizes, and in live promotions. Old Thirties cartoons like Scrappy and serials would be introduced between breaks, and occasionally there were special appearances, as when The Three Stooges came to visit the Starfinder II.\n\nThere were changes in format, but the show ran for a decade, from the 1960s to the early 1970s.
