It was produced by ITV and Coastal Productions but ITV never aired the mini series in the UK. It was only shown in the US on PBS and in Ontario, Canada because of the PBS affiliate in Buffalo, New York that is received across the border.\n\nIt was a smart and unusual series that involved the two characters Mark and Maeve, who did not previously know each other, dying and then finding themselves continuing to exist as spirits. After their deaths, they learn there are some rules to this existence. One is that they can interact somewhat with the living - but the living will forget anything that happened and anything that was said with Mark and Maeve once these two have left their presence. The other is that, unlike with strangers, they cannot interact at all with the people who were closest to them, they can only observe what is happening with them. Mark and Maeve's frustration intensifies at not being capable of intervening directly in their loved one's lives. Instead they must find a way to do so indirectly, which was very tricky. From this they realize they are a shade of their former selves. Still conscious, yet diminished somehow on the physical plane. The series follows their attempts to set things right in the lives of new people they encounter, because of the unique advantage they have of being able to see the circumstances that these people are not aware of, and also their attempts to resolve the mess their personal lives were abruptly left in. The writer handled the story with these very specific rules. This made for great drama, seeing how Mark and Maeve would resolve the conflicts of their unfinished lives. The ambient theme music was perfectly suited to the series, sounding as if it were something made in the spirit world.","original_name":"Shades","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Shades","cert":"Unavailable","id":59549,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Monster Man is a reality TV series shown on Syfy.","original_name":"Monster Man","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Monster Man","cert":"Unavailable","id":59550,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"The Song Shop was a Canadian children's music television series which aired on CBC Television in 1958.","original_name":"The Song Shop","vote_average":0.0,"name":"The Song Shop","cert":"Unavailable","id":59551,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Nanny Daddy is a Singaporean drama which aired on Channel 8.
