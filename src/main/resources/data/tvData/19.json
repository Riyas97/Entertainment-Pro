Filming was based in Reading police station and took place in 1980 and early 1981.\n\nThe series had a significant impact on debate about the role of the police. The most influential episode was the third, A complaint of rape, in which a woman who claimed to have been raped by three men was treated harshly and dismissively by three male police officers. The public reaction led to changes in the way in which the UK police handled rape cases. In less than a year, Reading police station had a new dedicated rape squad consisting of five female police officers.","original_name":"Police","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Police","cert":"Unavailable","id":9465,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[99],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle is an anime TV Special based on the Neo Geo SNK video game, Fatal Fury 2, and is a sequel to the previous TV movie, Fatal Fury: Legend of the Hungry Wolf.

Secondly, it was the first television production where the camera was made into one of the 'characters' of the piece \u2013 the play revolves around the first-person perspective of the character whose viewpoint the camera represents, and who is not otherwise seen, his voice heard only in voiceover. The play ends with the main character faced with a firing squad.\n\nThe cast consisted of Reginald Brooke, Zoe Davies, Olga Edwardes, Wilfred Fletcher, Neil Porter, Hilary Pritchard, Henry Belling and Ben Soutten.\n\nTwenty minutes in length, the play was written by R.E.J.
