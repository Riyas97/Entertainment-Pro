The expedition team, which includes specialist zoologists, explorers and the BBC crew, travels to the extinct volcano of Mount Bosavi in central Papua New Guinea to document the biodiversity of this little-visited area and search for new species. At the time of filming, logging was taking place about 20 miles (32 km) south from the volcano, and one of expedition's aims was to find evidence to support the case to protect the area. Some members of the expedition team travelled to the island of New Britain several hundred kilometres to the east to chart an unexplored cave system and observe an active volcano.  The series was broadcast in September 2009 on BBC One in the United Kingdom in a three-part run. In the United States, it was broadcast the same month in seven parts on consecutive nights.","release_date":"2012-01-14","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":107,"cert":"N\/A","id":377459,"title":"BBC Earth - New Guinea","adult":false,"genre_ids":[99]},{"cast":["Darryl Strawberry","Dwight Gooden"],"overview":"When they were good, they were the biggest stars on a team that captured New York City and the 1986 World Series. But when they were bad, Doc Gooden and Darryl Strawberry broke the hearts of Mets fans. \"They were going to be our guys for years,\" laments Jon Stewart in this evocative yet searing 30 for 30 documentary directed by Judd Apatow (\"Trainwreck\") and Michael Bonfiglio (\"You Don't Know Bo\"). Reunited at a diner in Queens, the pitcher and the power hitter look back on the glory days of the mid-'80s and the harrowing nights that turned them from surefire Hall of Famers into prisoners of their own addictions. Listening to Doc talk about missing the parade down the Canyon of Heroes, or Darryl counsel others at his ministry, you can only wish that these two very different men had not followed the same destructive path.","release_date":"2016-07-14","vote_average":7.3,"runtime":78,"cert":"\"\"","id":377461,"title":"Doc & Darryl","adult":false,"genre_ids":[99]},{"cast":["Herbert Rawlinson","Madge Bellamy","Nick De Ruiz","George Beranger","Dorothy Brock"],"overview":"Tom Conlin, an Irish cop walking a beat in an Italian neighborhood, falls in love with Tita Sartori, the daughter of a florist.
