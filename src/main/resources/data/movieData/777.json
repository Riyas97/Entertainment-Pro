Thomas (Vassilis Eleftheriadis) and Achilleas (Ierassimos Skiadaeressis) make an illegal late-night run at the Greek border, joined by young Nikos (Antonis Manolas), a child whose mother had been killed by Albanian guards. Returning to Athens, they find that the land they had missed and dreamed of so often has changed, refusing to accept the returning refugees or even see them as Greek -- the locals refer to the trio as \"Albanians\" throughout the film. Demoralized and disillusioned, Thomas is accidentally killed while working at a building site to make ends meet, and Achilleas and Nikos decide to return to their Albanian village rather than stay in an Athens, which clearly has no place for them anymore.","release_date":"1993-03-16","vote_average":6.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":388281,"title":"From the Snow","adult":false,"genre_ids":[18]},{"cast":["Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu","Laura Morante","Philippe Nahon","Roland Amstutz"],"overview":"What there is of a plot in this drama serves mainly as a vehicle for the exploration of character.
