All parts are linked in showing the progression of a devastating skin disease of two ten-year-old boys which is successively revealed to be the progression of a skilfully applied special effects make-up. Shot against coloured backdrops, the first sections show portraits of the boys who are introduced by preceding titles as Khalil and Shaun. The third section is a dramatic sequence based on one of the last scenes in John Cassavetes's film A Woman Under the Influence (1974). Lockhart refrains from reproducing the scene literally. Instead, she places and collapses several moments into one, amplifying the main theme of the film - the attempt to pretend that everything is okay. Shaun is presented with his face horribly disfigured by blisters and wounds. His mother's pledges of future happiness thus become rather ominous.","release_date":"1994-01-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":16,"cert":"\"\"","id":458403,"title":"Khalil, Shaun, A Woman Under the Influence","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":["Ian Boldsworth","Barry Dodds"],"overview":"What the title says...what more do you want to know?","release_date":"2018-12-31","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":458405,"title":"The ParaPod Movie","adult":false,"genre_ids":[27,99]},{"cast":[],"overview":"","release_date":"","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":458407,"title":"24 hours","adult":true,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":["Елисавета Шопова","Иван Иванов","Филип Трифонов","Антон Радичев","Златина Тодева"],"overview":"","release_date":"1994-01-20","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":458409,"title":"Gori Gori Oganche","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":["Mickey Rourke","Prem Singh","Janel Parrish","Michael Pugliese","Marshall Manesh"],"overview":"A practicing Sikh is banned by the boxing commission for refusing to back down from his religious beliefs.
