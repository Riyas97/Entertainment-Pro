He takes money without permission and travels to Goa along with his friends. Once there, he meets and falls in love with Shruti Tyagi - but she rejects him. Two years later, the duo meet again, and he finds out that her father, B.K. Tyagi, is Rameshwar's doctor, and builds up enough courage to seek his permission to marry Shruti - but is told that she is soon to marry U.S.-based Raj.

Watch what impact this kidnapping has on Raj, the entire Tyagi family, as well as on Rameshwar and the rest of the family - especially when they find out that Vivek has been lying to them.","release_date":"2011-01-07","vote_average":2.0,"runtime":109,"cert":"N\/A","id":302170,"title":"Impatient Vivek","adult":false,"genre_ids":[35,18,10749]},{"cast":["Vico Torriani","Peer Schmidt","Karin Dor","Hubert von Meyerinck","Alexander Golling"],"overview":"","release_date":"1956-08-19","vote_average":5.0,"runtime":95,"cert":"N\/A","id":302172,"title":"Santa Lucia","adult":false,"genre_ids":[10402,35,80]},{"cast":[],"overview":"1972 film starring Ashok Kumar, Suresh Chatwal, Alka, Paintal, Jagdeep, Nazneen","release_date":"1972-12-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"\"\"","id":302174,"title":"Jawani Mastani","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":["Harald Juhnke","Karin Dor","Oskar Sima","Hubert von Meyerinck","Fritz Tillmann"],"overview":"","release_date":"1959-01-15","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":302176,"title":"Skandal um Dodo","adult":false,"genre_ids":[35]},{"cast":["Daniela Flynn","Paul Lange","Russell Dennis Lewis","Ryan Nelson","Corey Rieger"],"overview":"After a global nuclear war has turned earth into a scorched wasteland, a struggling group of survivors discovers a secret installation that offers a new beginning - but not without a catch.","release_date":"2014-11-10","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":22,"cert":"\"\"","id":302178,"title":"Phoenix 9","adult":false,"genre_ids":[28,53,878]},{"cast":["Collette Wolfe","Mary Lynn Rajskub","John Ennis","David Hoffman","Steve Berg"],"overview":"For Raquel and Peter Jacobs, getting their little boy George into the prestigious Le Chance Academy is going to be a lot harder than they expected.","release_date":"2014-05-22","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":85,"cert":"\"\"","id":302186,"title":"Play Nice","adult":false,"genre_ids":[35]},{"cast":[],"overview":"1963 film from India","release_date":"1963-01-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"\"\"","id":302188,"title":"Kanya Rathna","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":[],"overview":"\"Year Of The Flood\" is a recording of Runrig's \"Beat The Drum\" outdoor concert on 18 August 2007 at Borlum Farm, near Drumnadrochit, on the shores of Loch Ness in the Highlands.
