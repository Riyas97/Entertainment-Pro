Dale would rather sleep in his matchbox, but an angry kick from Chip gets him working furiously. But there's only so much they can do. Their tree is nearly out of acorns. Luckily, the two semi-intelligible chipmunks happen to see the half-unintelligible Donald Duck, a park ranger, planting acorns. They immediately set to steal his bag of the precious nuts. Donald soon realizes what they are up to, and sets out a box propped up with a stick. It's a crude trap, with an acorn as bait; but it's not too crude to fool Dale, who upsets it and traps Chip. Soon, Donald finds he can have fun instigating a fight between these two quarrelsome chipmunks, but he underestimates their friendship and their ability to work as a team against a common enemy: in this case, a bad-tempered duck.","release_date":"1949-06-03","vote_average":6.5,"runtime":7,"cert":"N\/A","id":67789,"title":"Winter Storage","adult":false,"genre_ids":[16]},{"cast":["Pinto Colvig","Walt Disney","Marcellite Garner"],"overview":"The princess (Minnie) is to wed the Prince (Goofy, still known as Dippy Dawg) against her wishes.

According to many authorities, since the late 1950s subliminal content has been tested and delivered through all forms of mass-media including Hollywood filmmakers Alfred Hitchcock and William Friedkin. Even our modern military has been accused of these practices in the \"war on terror\" against soldiers and civilians both abroad and at home. With eye-opening footage, revealing interviews, humorous anecdotes, and an array of visual effects, the film categorically explores the alleged usage of subliminals in advertising, music, film, television, anti-theft devices, political propaganda, military psychological operations, and advanced weapons development. Director Jeff Warrick makes it his personal mission to determine if these manipulative tactics have succeeded in \"programming the nation?\" Or, if subliminal messaging belongs in the category of what many consider urban legend.","release_date":"2011-08-19","vote_average":5.0,"runtime":104,"cert":"N\/A","id":67908,"title":"Programming The Nation?","adult":false,"genre_ids":[99]},{"cast":["Nick Swardson","Christina Ricci","Stephen Dorff","Don Johnson","Ido Mosseri"],"overview":"A kid from the Midwest moves out to Hollywood in order to follow in his parents footsteps -- and become a porn star.","release_date":"2011-09-09","vote_average":4.3,"runtime":97,"cert":"","id":67911,"title":"Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star","adult":false,"genre_ids":[35]},{"cast":["Florian Fitz","Fritz Karl","Susan Atwell","Rolf Kanies","Julia Richter"],"overview":"At the party, her friend Sabine Andrea suddenly stands before her former boyfriend Eric .
