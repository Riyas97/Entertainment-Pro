And in period footage of Brower's early rock-climbs (done in sneakers, with hemp ropes) and of his training in the 10th Mountain Division (who defeated the Nazis in the high Alps).","release_date":"2004-08-19","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":88,"cert":"N\/A","id":41320,"title":"Monumental: David Brower's Fight for Wild America","adult":false,"genre_ids":[99]},{"cast":["John Sayles","Wallace Shawn","Paul Robeson","Lili Taylor"],"overview":"An impressive roster of celebrities -- including Lili Taylor, Paul Robeson, Sarah Jones, Brian Jones, John Sayles and Wallace Shawn -- lend their voices to this performance of readings inspired by Howard Zinn's best-selling book.
