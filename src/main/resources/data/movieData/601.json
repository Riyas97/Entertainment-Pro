Paik, amongst other artists who shared the same vision in the 1960s, saw the potential in the television beyond it being a one-sided medium to present programs and commercials. Instead, he saw it more as a place to facilitate a free flow of information exchange. He wanted to strip away the limitations from  copyright system and network restrictions and bring in a new TV culture where information can be accessed inexpensively and conveniently.  The full length of the piece ran 28 minutes and was first broadcasted in January 30, 1974 on WNET. It can be described as a visual collage made up of elements from various mediums. For example, he mixes together footage from Pepsi commercials and his own earlier works with pop music and artist contributions from people such as John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Charlotte Moorman.
