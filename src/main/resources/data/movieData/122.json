Starting from their mid-60's garage band roots (sounding amazingly like the Sonics), the Motor City 5 deveoped into an icon for a brand of loud, crushing music reflecting their industrial roots. Even if you don't care for their music (and you're bound to like even a few of their songs), their story is fascinating. It combines 60's protest, youthful braggadocio, and a style of music that would help carry one to the likes of Iggy and the Stooges (not to mention certain aspects of punk rock). This film is clearly a labor of love, combining extraordinarily rare live shows, still shots, a nearly-continuous backdrop of MC5 tunes, penetrating interviews with the remaining members and their spouses, and even FBI surveillance shots. It's the ultimate testimonial to a band that only gains in stature as time goes on.","release_date":"2002-02-02","vote_average":8.0,"runtime":120,"cert":"N\/A","id":60645,"title":"MC5: A True Testimonial","adult":false,"genre_ids":[10402,99]},{"cast":["Glenn Ford","William Holden","Ellen Drew","Ray Collins","Edgar Buchanan"],"overview":"Two friends return home after their discharge from the army after the Civil War.
