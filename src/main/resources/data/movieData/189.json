Paget was able to sneak his film (and himself) out of the country, and next visited Vietnam and Cambodia, hoping to photograph Angor Wat. As one might expect, Paget and his traveling companion were both arrested, but upon his release, Paget discovered he'd developed a taste for danger. He spent much of the next few years scrambling to the world's trouble spots and throwing himself into the face of war or civil disturbance in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, South Africa, Germany, Moscow, Cairo, and Israel, which was as close to the Gulf War as he was able to get before missiles began to fall.","release_date":"1999-01-24","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":82,"cert":"N\/A","id":94410,"title":"American Passport","adult":false,"genre_ids":[99]},{"cast":[],"overview":"","release_date":"1962-01-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":75,"cert":"N\/A","id":94411,"title":"The Warfare of Landmine","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":["Cindy David","Kolia Litscher","Lila Salet"],"overview":"Demi-Tarif follows the low-key adventures of three young siblings, Romeo, Launa, and the youngest - Leo, left on their own in a rundown Paris apartment.
