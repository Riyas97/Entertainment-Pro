The Cumbia proposed by Ali, Pilar, Flor, Pat, Inés and Juana is strongly influenced by their past. Their political, musical, cultural ideas, their Do-it-Yourself style and the recent Argentinian history still have an effect on the content of their lyrics, their performance and their way of life. Through the musicians we learn how to survive by making music in Argentina and México and how the Queer and danceable way of being Punk is perceived there.","release_date":"2014-04-13","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":45,"cert":"N\/A","id":265455,"title":"Kumbia Queers: More Louder Bitte","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":["Laura Albert","James Short","Jess Hahn","Bruce Baron","Gordon Mitchell"],"overview":"Karen, a beautiful air hostess, is implied by her fiance in international drug trafficking: drugged herself, she lets persuade to convey ten kilos of heroin from North Africa to Spain.
