The year is 1969, and Sacha (Marie Bunel) is a young Belgian woman living in Canada. Sacha's family sent her to Canada to attend medical school, but she hasn't had the heart to tell them that she's dropped out of college to devote herself to her new interest in photography. Sacha also hasn't told her parents that she's a lesbian -- and that she has a new girlfriend, Odile (Macha Grenon). Odile is tired of being kept a secret, and insists that Sacha tell her parents the truth before American astronauts land on the moon in a few months -- or else. Sacha flies home to Belgium for a visit, planning to come clean to her folks, but she discovers they've arranged a huge welcome home party for the entire neighborhood. With everyone so excited that the soon-to-be-doctor is paying them a visit, Sacha wonders when the time will be right to give her family the news.","release_date":"2001-07-04","vote_average":5.4,"runtime":98,"cert":"N\/A","id":78790,"title":"Family Pack","adult":false,"genre_ids":[18,35]},{"cast":["Michael McVey","Pheona McLellan","Patrick Troughton","Jeff Rawle","Sorcha Cusack"],"overview":"Two children help an eccentric professor test his new time machine.","release_date":"1978-05-05","vote_average":6.0,"runtime":57,"cert":"U","id":78791,"title":"A Hitch in Time","adult":false,"genre_ids":[10751,878]},{"cast":["Mohammed Metina","Jacques Bastide","Cyril Lecomte","Jeanne Dhivers","Didier Becchetti"],"overview":"","release_date":"2003-07-09","vote_average":8.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":78792,"title":"Travail d'arabe","adult":false,"genre_ids":[18,35]},{"cast":["Simon Talbot"],"overview":"","release_date":"2011-11-08","vote_average":6.4,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":78793,"title":"Simon Talbot: Damp","adult":false,"genre_ids":[35,10749]},{"cast":["Laurence Côte","Alexandre Brasseur","Fabio Zenoni","Stéphane Metzger","Emilie Alibert"],"overview":"","release_date":"2006-03-15","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":78794,"title":"Quand les anges s'en mêlent","adult":false,"genre_ids":[35,10749]},{"cast":["Marcel Borràs","Irene Escolar","Cristina Dilla","Eduard Farelo","Carlos Cuevas"],"overview":"This movie does not have a plot","release_date":"2010-11-02","vote_average":8.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":78795,"title":"Cruzando el límite","adult":false,"genre_ids":[18]},{"cast":["Lars Brandeby","Reuben Sallmander","Eric Ericson","Dag Malmberg","Moa Gammel"],"overview":"","release_date":"2011-11-09","vote_average":5.3,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":78796,"title":"Irene Huss 11: I skydd av skuggorna","adult":false,"genre_ids":[80,18,53]},{"cast":["Michel Constantin","Marcel Bozzuffi","Angelo Infanti","Henry Silva","Nicole Calfan"],"overview":"","release_date":"1973-03-15","vote_average":6.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":78797,"title":"Les hommes","adult":false,"genre_ids":[80]},{"cast":["Dany Boon"],"overview":"","release_date":"2011-11-23","vote_average":6.6,"runtime":100,"cert":"N\/A","id":78798,"title":"Dany Boon - Trop stylé","adult":false,"genre_ids":[35]},{"cast":["Manny Pacquiao","Freddie Roach"],"overview":"Way back in 2004 Filipino Pacquiao knocked Márquez down three times in the first round, but the battle went the distance, the pair couldn't be separated by the judges and a draw was declared.
