The story is set in the 80s rock scene and revolves around Nakajima (Kazunobu Mineta), the lead singer of a band called 'Speed Way'. Because he refuses to write trite, pop-friendly songs he is constantly at odds with his own record company. However, he refuses to bend on his rock principles simply for better record sales. The most interesting parts of this movie is how they pay homage to music icon, Bob Dylan who gave the filmmaker his blessing, which is no small feat itself, especially for a Japanese indie debut.","release_date":"2003-01-01","vote_average":8.0,"runtime":118,"cert":"N\/A","id":58505,"title":"Iden & Tity","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":["Irene Grandi","Nino Manfredi","Ludovica Modugno","Raf"],"overview":"","release_date":"2003-01-01","vote_average":7.1,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":58506,"title":"L'apetta Giulia e la signora Vita","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":["Brian Dennehy","Anne Archer","Hallie Todd","Michael Bowen","Chris Hebert"],"overview":"Frustrated with all the minor irritants of the rat-race Richard Jackson decides to buy a goat, disconnect the electricity and become self-sufficient.

The other major storyline was the return of Hulk Hogan, who had departed the WWF following WrestleMania VIII but returned to team with Brutus Beefcake against the WWF Tag Team Champions, Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster).  Several reviewers have been critical of the event. The most frequent criticism has been related to the match between The Undertaker and Giant Gonzalez, Hulk Hogan's win, and the Roman togas worn by announcers.
