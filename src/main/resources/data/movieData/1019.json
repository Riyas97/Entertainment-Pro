As San Francisco grew and gentrified, communities changed, shifted, and were displaced. Bars, restaurants, parks, alleys, bathhouses, and other gathering spots of the queer community were remodeled, repurposed, rebuilt, or destroyed. Submerged Queer Spaces looks at the architectural remains of historic sites and buildings in San Francisco. Eight interview subjects recount firsthand experiences in these lost environs. Gerald Fabien experienced gay San Francisco before WWII, and tells tales of sailors, mariners, and the dangers of Union Square cruising. Guy Clark and Jae Whitaker discuss the unexpected racism they experienced in supposedly liberal, gay San Francisco.","release_date":"2012-03-05","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":100,"cert":"\"\"","id":509325,"title":"Submerged Queer Spaces","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":["Sergey Girin","Anna Shvol","Lyubov Strizhak"],"overview":"","release_date":"2013-06-20","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":509336,"title":"Счастливый конец","adult":false,"genre_ids":[18]},{"cast":["Leonid Khishba","Nelli Lakoba","Lavrentiy Akhba","Teimuraz Tania","Tamara Gamgia"],"overview":"","release_date":"2013-04-04","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":509338,"title":"Alhas and Juliet","adult":false,"genre_ids":[35]},{"cast":["Kristin Muri","Haley Beauregard","Daniel Scot Kadin","Eric Eastman","Maggie Wagner"],"overview":"The day after their 15th anniversary, a couple, Michael and Janet are preparing for a meal with guests: long time friends, Muriel and Brian.
