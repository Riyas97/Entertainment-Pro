GRAVEYARD ALIVE is a cross between 1920's German Expressionism and 1960's B-horror films. Shot in and around the Montreal area, this is Bastard Amber Production's first full-length feature.  The story follows Patsy, a lonely, dreamy nurse who, after being bitten by a zombie, becomes a sex-kitten. With her newfound powers, she tries to win back her old flame, the suave and handsome Dr. Dox, from Goodie , a bitchy young nurse. As the film progresses, Patsy must also learn to deal with her new affliction and to live her life, no longer in her romantic dream world, but in a harsher yet ultimately more satisfying reality.  Shot in Techniscope with a 1:2.35 aspect ratio, an old process used in many 1960's films such as Dario Argento's \"The Cat O' Nine Tails\", GRAVEYARD ALIVE promises to invigorate the horror genre stylistically as well as with its audacious and thought-provoking content.","release_date":"2003-01-01","vote_average":5.6,"runtime":80,"cert":"N\/A","id":88006,"title":"Graveyard Alive- A Zombie Nurse in Love","adult":false,"genre_ids":[35,27]},{"cast":["Bob Einstein","Dan Hedaya","Gia Carides","Don Lake","Art Irizawa"],"overview":"Super Dave Osborne, our accident-prone stuntman hero, comes out of a self-imposed retirement to raise money for his new girlfriend's son's heart operation.","release_date":"2000-01-11","vote_average":3.9,"runtime":91,"cert":"N\/A","id":88007,"title":"The Extreme Adventures of Super Dave","adult":false,"genre_ids":[28,35]},{"cast":["James Booth","Barbara Windsor","Roy Kinnear","Avis Bunnage","Brian Murphy"],"overview":"Charlie returns to the East End after two years at sea to find his house demolished and wife Maggie gone.
