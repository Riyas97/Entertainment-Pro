[{"cast":[],"overview":"Belonging: The Truth Behind the Headlines is an investigative feature documentary film about where power lies in this country. With some explosive reveals about government and business collusion - we re-look at events around 3 industrial disputes, 3 governments and over 3 decades. The impact of such government and corporate power on individuals, communities, democracy and human rights in the UK is heart rendering. We reveal - a secret government plan to destroy community and collectivism and acts outside the law. The documents we have found prove what has long been suspected by many but not proven - until now. Through heart rendering personal stories from those at the heart of these industrial disputes we show the impact of the actions of those in power on individuals and communities - but also question what lies ahead.
