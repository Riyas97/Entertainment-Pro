Rather than just creating a biographical sketch or a performance film, Karmakar attempts to give viewers an insight into Villalobos's creative process, his philosophy towards his music and his work, how his background has informed his art, and how his interaction with the audience informs his selections during a DJ set in unexpected ways.","release_date":"2009-09-08","vote_average":10.0,"runtime":110,"cert":"N\/A","id":29956,"title":"Villalobos","adult":false,"genre_ids":[99]},{"cast":["Wayne Crawford","Jason Evers","Roberta Leighton","Cliff Emmich","William Kerwin"],"overview":"Little coastal town is being terrorized by deadly Barracudas.","release_date":"1978-10-16","vote_average":4.1,"runtime":98,"cert":"N\/A","id":29957,"title":"Barracuda","adult":false,"genre_ids":[27,53]},{"cast":["William Katt","Wayne Crawford","Kate Connor","Russel Savadier","Dawn Matthews"],"overview":"A group of American tourists heading down an African river make a brief stop at Snake Island, an island that has been virtually abandoned for years.
