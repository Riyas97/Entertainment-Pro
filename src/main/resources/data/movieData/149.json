Based upon his critically acclaimed stage show, Wake Up and Smell the Coffee is Bogosian at his funniest, smartest, and angriest. Taking us for a ferocious ride through a cavalcade of colorful characters in his mind, Bogosian skewers pop culture, conformity, religious hypocrisy and human nature itself with a razor-sharp wit. Whether he\u2019s playing Satan as a modern-day salesman, a Hollywood producer capitalizing on an airplane disaster, a spiritual guru with questionable motives, or mocking himself as an obsequious actor auditioning for a part, Bogosian tackles today\u2019s relevant, post-9\/11 themes with uncompromising honesty.","release_date":"2001-01-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":77,"cert":"N\/A","id":74139,"title":"Eric Bogosian: Wake Up and Smell the Coffee","adult":false,"genre_ids":[35]},{"cast":["Paul Bowles","William S.
