It was adapted from a novella by Wenders' long-time collaborator Peter Handke. A goalkeeper is sent off during a game for committing a foul. He spends the night with a cinema cashier, whom he afterwards kills. Although a type of detective film, it is more slow moving and contemplative than other films of the genre. It explores the monotony of the murderer's existence and, like many of Wenders' films, the overwhelming cultural influence of America in post-war West Germany.","release_date":"1972-02-19","vote_average":5.0,"runtime":101,"cert":"N\/A","id":42481,"title":"The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick","adult":false,"genre_ids":[80,18]},{"cast":["Elvis Presley","James Burton","John Wilkinson","Jerry Scheff","Glen D.
