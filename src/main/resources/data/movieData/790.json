The many lives lost in the building of the first tunnel were considered to be one of the costs for economic progress. In one re-enactment, a strike for better conditions is severely dealt with by the military. Even in 1972, though working conditions were better, most of the men working on the tunnel were poor immigrant workers, with almost no power to negotiate better treatment.","release_date":"1977-04-27","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":90,"cert":"N\/A","id":394957,"title":"San Gottardo","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":[],"overview":"Cannes Film festival 1977","release_date":"1972-04-26","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":394960,"title":"Tribute to Bogart","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":[],"overview":"Cine Follies is a film anthology focusing chiefly on French comedies and musicals of the 1930s interspersed with newsreel footage.
