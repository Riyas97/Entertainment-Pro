Confident and secure and brimming with sexuality, a Colt man is the untamed essence of male desire. Just below that handsome and rugged demeanor are an urge so strong and a desire that runs deep. A Colt man knows what he needs, and he knows he needs to get it from another Colt man. Award-winning director John Rutherford brings you the hot and heavy hook ups... the passionate man-on-man encounters... and the hedonistic pleasures of men.","release_date":"","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":75,"cert":"N\/A","id":292972,"title":"Man Tricks","adult":true,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":["Steve Earle","Justin Townes Earle"],"overview":"A musical documentary film about the politically minded singer\/songwriter Steve Earle.","release_date":"2003-06-07","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":95,"cert":"N\/A","id":292974,"title":"Just an American Boy","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":[],"overview":"In this dark comedy, defense lawyer Jake Jorgenson's carefully constructed life begins to unravel when he kills his wife's lover.","release_date":"2002-04-26","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"\"\"","id":292976,"title":"Lansdown","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":["Cynthia Hopkins"],"overview":"Written by legendary theater artist, Richard Foreman, Planet Earth: Dreams revolves around the desire to escape -- not to a Dream world -- but to a mode of consciousness in which one is able to function in real life with the same mental freedom the dream mind has available in the realm of sleep.","release_date":"2004-07-14","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"\"\"","id":292978,"title":"Planet Earth: Dreams","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":[],"overview":"When two women with a video camera follow an HIV research team to Eritrea, Africa, they find a strange and magical country which transforms their documentary into an intimate investigation of their own capacities to love, suffer and forgive.","release_date":"2001-10-19","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":90,"cert":"\"\"","id":292980,"title":"White Hotel","adult":false,"genre_ids":[99]},{"cast":["Idina Menzel","Kristen Bell","Jennifer Lee","Josh Gad","Walt Disney"],"overview":"A behind-the-scene look at the origins and evolution of the Academy Award-winning film.","release_date":"2014-09-15","vote_average":7.2,"runtime":44,"cert":"\"NR\"","id":292985,"title":"The Story of Frozen: Making a Disney Animated Classic","adult":false,"genre_ids":[99]},{"cast":["Martial Le Minoux"],"overview":"A tiny and mysterious cat-like creature awakes in the remains of his smouldering spaceship and finds himself on a journey through a beautiful and dangerous world, in a quest for answers.","release_date":"2014-03-29","vote_average":5.0,"runtime":6,"cert":"N\/A","id":292987,"title":"Space Cat Hob","adult":false,"genre_ids":[28,16,12,878]},{"cert":"N\/A","title":"Gerechtigkeit in Worowogorsk","cast":["Lucie Mannheim","Georg Thomalla","Vera Tschechowa","Walter Kohut","Herbert Fleischmann"],"id":292998,"overview":"","runtime":null,"genre_ids":[35],"release_date":"1964-06-30","vote_average":0.0,"adult":false}]
