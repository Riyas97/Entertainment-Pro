Though Ann Savage and Tom Neal are top-billed, the central character is supporting-actor Roland Varno. He plays a Nazi spy who sneaks into the U.S., hoping to release hundreds of German prisoners. He fails, but not until plenty of bullets have been spent. The most interesting aspect of The Unwritten Code is the casting of Savage and Neal as the \"good\" characters: in 1945, these two cult favorites would play the decidedly unsavory protagonists of the film noir classic Detour.","release_date":"1944-10-25","vote_average":5.0,"runtime":61,"cert":"\"\"","id":369988,"title":"The Unwritten Code","adult":false,"genre_ids":[18]},{"cast":["Manuel Poblete","Carmen Messuti","Arturo Calderón","Juan Avilán","Rafael Briceño"],"overview":"This anthology film consists of three parts: \"Story One: The story of the brave man\", \"Story Two: Angels Rhythm\" and \"Story Three: The false office of supernumerary\".
