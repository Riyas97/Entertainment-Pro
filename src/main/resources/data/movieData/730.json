Ricky makes the aquaintance of Ralph Bitondo (also played by Joey Lawrence), a pizza delivery boy who looks almost exactly like Ricky -- so much so that the two decide to trade identities for a while. Ricky enjoys being able to live like an average guy for a change, and Ralph gets a kick out of the perks of stardom, but predictably enough they both learn the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Also known as The Prince and the Pizza Boy, Prince for a Day also stars Richard Belzer and Khrystyne Haje.","release_date":"1995-10-06","vote_average":8.0,"runtime":105,"cert":"\"\"","id":364507,"title":"Prince For a Day","adult":false,"genre_ids":[35]},{"cast":[],"overview":"One womans journey to learn an endangered songline from remote Arnhem Land that explores cycles of death, life, rain, tears, and the replenishment and abundance of land, sea and spirit, and the quest to ensure this ancient songline is practiced for generations to come.","release_date":"2015-01-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":25,"cert":"N\/A","id":364509,"title":"Bulunu Milkarri","adult":false,"genre_ids":[18]},{"cast":["Jiří Krampol","Dagmar Patrasová","Iva Janžurová","Josef Dvořák","Pavel Trávníček"],"overview":"","release_date":"1986-01-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":364511,"title":"Jak se mele babí hněv","adult":false,"genre_ids":[12,10751]},{"cast":["Marcel Vašinka","Ondřej Havelka","Jaroslav Moučka","Eva Jakoubková","Ivan Luťanský"],"overview":"","release_date":"1982-12-24","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":364513,"title":"Jak se peče štěstí","adult":false,"genre_ids":[12,10751,10770]},{"cast":["Pedro Fontaine","Cristobal Tapia Montt","Ingrid Veninger","Vanessa Ramos","Leonardo Fini"],"overview":"Love is everything with a young man journey's from the north to south of Chile to fulfill a promise.","release_date":"2015-10-18","vote_average":7.0,"runtime":80,"cert":"N\/A","id":364515,"title":"He Hated Pigeons","adult":false,"genre_ids":[18]},{"cast":["Lasse Rimmer","Brian Mørk"],"overview":"","release_date":"2014-08-29","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":364517,"title":"Mørk og Rimmer: Redder Verden","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":[],"overview":"An industrial film instructing employees in the then-new air travel industry how to deal with problem customers.","release_date":"1947-01-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":364528,"title":"They Travel By Air","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":[],"overview":"Sixteen-year-old An-ran gets into repeated trouble because she refuses blind obedience to authority, openly challenging and correcting a teacher who makes a mistake in class.
