During the early 1950's the very existence of this camp for political prisoners at Recsk was one of the Hungarian communist regime's deepest secrets. Hundreds of people were taken there without ever actually being sentenced by any court, and had to suffer through the brutal treatment handed down by their sadistic captors. This documentary tells the story of Recsk from both the captors' and the prisoners' point of view, capturing the atmosphere of paranoia, humiliation and degradation that prevailed throughout the Stalinist gulag system.","release_date":"1987-11-30","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":230,"cert":"N\/A","id":523905,"title":"Recsk 1950\u201353: Story of a Forced Labor Camp","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":["Miguel Ríos","Mariano Díaz","Thijs van Leer","Tato Gómez","Sergio Castillo"],"overview":"","release_date":"1982-05-12","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":523916,"title":"Miguel Ríos: Rock & Ríos","adult":false,"genre_ids":[10402]},{"cast":["Baya Rehaz","Sara Verhagen","Marie Lanchau","Olivia Gotanègre","Caroline Anglade"],"overview":"","release_date":"2016-06-06","vote_average":8.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":523918,"title":"Barbara","adult":false,"genre_ids":[35]},{"cast":[],"overview":"An unseen alien manipulates the mind of a drug addict, forcing him to commit acts which he cannot recall later.","release_date":"2011-01-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":90,"cert":"\"\"","id":523920,"title":"Alien Inhabitant","adult":false,"genre_ids":[878]},{"cast":["Aaron Frazier","Tyrone Burton","Brian Keith Hall","Ernest Johnson","Shelli Boone"],"overview":"A heart warming story about three young men who specialize in recovering high end, expensive and well protected autos that are hard to retrieve due to lack of payments.","release_date":"2008-11-25","vote_average":1.0,"runtime":113,"cert":"\"\"","id":523922,"title":"Auto Recovery","adult":false,"genre_ids":[28,80,18]},{"cast":[],"overview":"The film with hooligan humor and serious sarcasm offers viewers to reflect on eternal, timeless values.","release_date":"2016-12-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":63,"cert":"N\/A","id":523924,"title":"I want to go in elevator alone","adult":false,"genre_ids":[18,35]},{"cast":["Robert Scott Wilson","David Proval","Paul Sorvino","Daryl Hannah","Frankie Avalon"],"overview":"A young man, Ben Freidman (Scott Wilson) raised by wealthy adoptive Jewish parents in Beverly Hills, decides that he is ready to finally meet his biological parents.
