Those five days in July were among the most pivotal \u2014 and divisive \u2014 in the city\u2019s history, with the turmoil leaving 43 dead. While the impending 50th anniversary of the summer of \u201967 was the impetus for the film, the home movie footage in \u201C12th and Clairmount\u201D captures a wide spectrum of Detroit life, from proud streetscapes to dance parties to neighborhood sporting events.  Drawing from more than 400 reels of donated home movies from the era, other unearthed footage and newly recorded oral histories, the documentary is being produced by the Free Press in collaboration with Bridge Magazine and WXYZ-TV (Channel 7) and a group of metro Detroit cultural institutions, led by the Detroit Institute of Arts.","release_date":"2017-03-30","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":75,"cert":"\"NR\"","id":449929,"title":"12th and Clairmount","adult":false,"genre_ids":[99]},{"cast":["Erika O'Bar","Carl Buffington","Johnathan Prince","Jimi Fleming","Brie Straiton"],"overview":"A young female paranormalist is pursued by a man claiming to be the devil in human form.","release_date":"2006-07-13","vote_average":1.0,"runtime":112,"cert":"\"\"","id":449931,"title":"Let Us Go and Burn Her Body; Or, The Devil Done Let Out","adult":false,"genre_ids":[9648,27]},{"cast":["Viktor Khomut","Valery Tcheplanowa","Thanasis Papageorgiou"],"overview":"11-year-old Misha is coming from Russia to Athens during the 2004 Olympic Games to live with his mother.
