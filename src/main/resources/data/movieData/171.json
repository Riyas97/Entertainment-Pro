Idenne utrolig morsomme Passer film møder vi Dirch som medlem af grundpersonalet hos SAS. Dirch har den lille fejl, at han er håbløst forelsket i en stewardesse (Agneta) og under sit arbejde, har han meget svært ved ikke at drømme om sin forelskelse. Gang på gang drømmer han sig ind i forskellige helteroller for på den måde at tiltrække sig opmærksomheden fra hans øjesten, Agneta. Vi møder Dirch som flykaptajn, arkæolog, gangster, sømand, prins, forsvarsadvokat, boksemester og soldat i det vilde vesten. Alt dette er roller som han lever sig ind i ved sine drømmerier. Men når man drømmer vågner man jo som regel igen, og det gør Peter (Dirch Passer) også, og hver gang finder han sig selv i de mest pinlige situationer. Spørgsmålet er om det nogensinde skal lykkes for Peter at få sin Agneta til at se til hans side, og vil hun overhovedet lægge mærke til at han drømmer om hende, og vil han kunne beholde sit job hos SAS? Alt dette og meget mere besvares i humør","release_date":"1955-01-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":70,"cert":"N\/A","id":85283,"title":"Masser af Passer","adult":false,"genre_ids":[35]},{"cast":["Masatoshi Nagase","Shirô Sano","Kiyotaka Nanbara","Yang Haitin","Te-chien Hou"],"overview":"Maiku Hama is a private detective working in Yokohama.
