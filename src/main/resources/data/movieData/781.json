After the young man runs away from being shackled to a cabin, he spends the winter in a cave and emerges as a bear (obviously a man wearing a bear suit). He is taken in by a writer who teaches him how to use a computer, which somehow poses no problem. The bear speaks like the young man and for awhile tries working as a computer operator, undoubtedly raising questions about the standards in that field. While invited to tea one afternoon, the bear kills a dog in self-defense and is forced to head back to his cave for the winter -- where he emerges after a long hibernation as the young man. In retrospect, contact with the computing world had quite a transforming effect.","release_date":"1984-04-05","vote_average":4.5,"runtime":115,"cert":"N\/A","id":390004,"title":"Ferocious","adult":false,"genre_ids":[14]},{"cast":["Pierre Curzi","Michel Daigle","Violaine Estérez","Marcel Sabourin","Marie Tifo"],"overview":"One day Jean-Baptiste Beauregard (Pierre Curzi) does not go out to face work or daily activities, instead he daydreams about the women in his past, about his teenage years, his failed marriage, and even his boyhood desires.

Annie Sprinkle plays an offbeat artist, Crystal Sync (billed here as Christa Anderson), who has a field day as a hedonist with a shitkicker Southern drawl, and the scene with a salami sausage is one you will never forget. Sonny does his Elvis impression, and all of them become victims of Crystal Sync's strange sexual orchestration control. Ultimately, C.J. and Hope resolve their problems with an assist from Annie.
