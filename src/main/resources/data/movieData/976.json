Death might terminate one branch of thought but it cannot obliterate human endeavor. The enterprise that is life continues.","release_date":"2017-01-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":80,"cert":"N\/A","id":487823,"title":"Death of a Poet","adult":false,"genre_ids":[18]},{"cast":[],"overview":"A short documentary about Braddock","release_date":"1980-11-18","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":2,"cert":"\"\"","id":487825,"title":"Homage to a Mill Town","adult":false,"genre_ids":[99]},{"cast":["Sal Carullo","Tony Buba"],"overview":"A portrait of a wiry, engaging street hustler, Sal Carulli, whose cocky patter breaks down at the end of the film, when he visits his father\u2019s grave.","release_date":"1979-11-18","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":26,"cert":"\"\"","id":487827,"title":"Sweet Sal","adult":false,"genre_ids":[99]},{"cast":["Lang Jeffries","Philippe Clay","Jacques Dufilho","Estella Blain","Jacques Dynam"],"overview":"Truck drivers hauling supplies are caught in the battle between the French and Arabs in this routine adventure drama.
