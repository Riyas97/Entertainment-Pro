Anne traveled with him on all his long truck journeys, and they had frequent and passionate sex. For quite a few years now, Anne has stayed at home to take care of their boy, who is a sickly, weedy little fellow. Pierre is frustrated. Anne is frustrated too but has her almost incestuous feeling for her son to torment her. Even little Nicolas is frustrated, in part due to the knowledge that his father feels that the sacrifice he and his mother made in raising him hasn't been worth the effort. He too has some release in the form of a good relationship with his gigantic dog. When the seething passions of these four discontented mammals reach a crisis point, the result (in this film) is exceedingly ironic.","release_date":"1992-03-18","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":388504,"title":"Sans un cri","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":["Betty Loh Tih","Yam Kit","Pat Ting Hung","Kong Hung","Margaret Tu Chuan"],"overview":"The Ching Dynasty novel The Dream of The Red Chamber is not only the most widely read, but also the most filmed book in Chinese history.

He works hard to organize traditional cultural events, such as outdoor performances of the traditional play I Chrissomalloussa, in order to solidify local values and a sense of identity. The teacher is aided by a young woman, a widow who has just returned from Germany and lives with her father-in-law. Kazan walks away with the film, as his sinister desires for his daughter-in-law are inflamed when he sees that she has fallen in love with the teacher. These developments lead him to whip up protests against the play by conservative locals, claiming that the teacher has changed the traditional story by adding elements of propaganda with the potential of causing peasant uprisings. The result is an unexpectedly violent example of social censorship.","release_date":"1979-03-19","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":388784,"title":"The Girl with Golden Hair","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":["Molly Morgen Lamont","William Waidmann","Rob Zabrecky"],"overview":"Everyone should have a friend to go trick or treating with.
