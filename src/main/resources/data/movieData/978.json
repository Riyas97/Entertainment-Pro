In it, he talks about real life struggles that we can all relate to - working from home whilst trying to avoid the internet. Luckily for us he doesn't manage to keep away from it for too long, as we get to see his search history looking at the work of some beloved performers together with the views of the YouTube commentary community.  When relaxing away from the internet we are also treated to a selection of videos that Adam has made that give a pretty good insight into his home life. He even says 'my wife' in a robot voice.","release_date":"2017-11-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":90,"cert":"N\/A","id":488818,"title":"Adam Buxton's Old Bits","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":["Olive Thomas","Rosemary Theby","Mary Charleson","Robert Ellis","Andrew Robson"],"overview":"Alice Chesterton ( Olive Thomas ), is described as a \"Baby Vamp\" by the social set and engaged to boring Tom Carey.
