[{"cast":[],"overview":"One of the most versatile sculptors working today is Tony Cragg. Shaping forms in plastic, glass, stone, wood, steel, fiberglass, and found objects he has been making magic come alive in hard materials since emerging in the mid-70s. His vocabulary is wide and his ideas explode across a broad creative landscape, destabilizing our normal viewing habits, while widening our perspective and attitudes. The Celebration of Sculpture is cinema verité at its most powerful. Cragg reveals himself while installing exhibitions of his work internationally, and restlessly moving around in his Wuppertal studio. Filmed in New York, California, London, Eindhoven, and Dusseldorf, one senses the peripatetic nature of a restless creator. The sculptor's workplace is where he prefers to be.","release_date":"","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":328517,"title":"Tony Cragg - In Celebration Of Sculpture","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":[],"overview":"This film is a peculiar story about the adventure of a group of young French riders. it is based on the images and the adventure, not performance.
