As motor traffic began to proliferate after the war, the trams were seen to be part of the reason for the growing congestion in the city. New electric trolleybuses were introduced to replace them on some routes before both they and the last of the trams were swept away in the 1960s with the final triumph of the motor car. These films, made mostly in the 1950s and 60s, are packed with memories of that era.
