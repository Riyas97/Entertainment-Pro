Giordano's Andrea Chenier is one of the greatest of verismo operas, full of heart-stopping big tunes and powerful emotional situations. If it is not as well-known as it should be, it is because in summary it sounds a little too like Puccini's Tosca: there is a tussle between political opponents over a woman, an attempt to save a condemned man, a tenor aria about writing poetry on the eve of execution. The difference is that Gerard (Giorgio Zancanaro) is not a villain like Scarpia, he is an idealist whom the French Revolution has betrayed as much as it has his rival the poet Chenier (Placido Domingo). His temptation to abuse his power to seduce the virtuous Maddalena (Anna Tomowa-Sintow) is a momentary one, though its consequences are terrible. There is a streak of post-Wagnerian decadence in much of this--Maddalena is at least as much in love with death as she is with Chenier, and the final love duet has a deeply sinister aspect.  -- From Amazon.co.uk","release_date":"1985-05-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":107,"cert":"N\/A","id":380939,"title":"Andrea Chénier","adult":false,"genre_ids":[10402]},{"cast":["Olga Gouriakova","Vsevolod Grivnov","Larissa Diadkova","Vladimir Matorin","Maxim Mikhailov"],"overview":"Live from ROH 2009, TV relay 1\/12\/2009.","release_date":"2009-11-23","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":154,"cert":"N\/A","id":380941,"title":"Cherevichki","adult":false,"genre_ids":[10402]},{"cast":["Julian Assange"],"overview":"A journey to the heart of tax havens and institutionalised secrecy with Rudolf Elmer, the Swiss whistleblower who, through WikiLeaks, revealed to the world the dirty secrets of a Swiss private bank located in the Cayman Islands.","release_date":"2016-01-20","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":76,"cert":"N\/A","id":380943,"title":"A Leak In Paradise","adult":false,"genre_ids":[99]},{"cast":[],"overview":"Drew Gulak vs. Louis Lyndon  Dan O'Hare &amp; Wheeler Utah vs. Kongo Kong  Allysin Kay &amp; Brittany Blake vs. Heidi Lovelace &amp; Kimber Lee  AAW Tag Team Title Match The Hooligans (c) vs. Zero Gravity  AAW Heavyweight Title #1 Contendership Match Chris Hero vs. Sami Callihan  Bucky Collins, Connor Braxton &amp; Eddie Machete vs. Markus Crane, Mat Fitchett &amp; Shane Hollister  Abyss vs. Ryan Boz  AAW Heritage Title Match Davey Vega (c) vs. AR Fox  AAW Heavyweight Title Match Eddie Kingston (c) vs. Trevor Lee","release_date":"2016-01-15","vote_average":4.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"\"NR\"","id":380945,"title":"AAW The Chaos Theory","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":["Lillian Gish","Spottiswoode Aitken","Sam De Grasse","Mary Alden","Seymour Hastings"],"overview":"Silent Drama","release_date":"1916-06-18","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":50,"cert":"\"\"","id":380947,"title":"An Innocent Magdalene","adult":false,"genre_ids":[18]},{"cast":["Tim Saunders","Mike Peters"],"overview":"On the 6th June 1944, Maj Howard\u2019s Coy of the OX &amp; Bucks LI carried out one of the greatest and most successful small unit actions in history in capturing the two Orne Bridges as a precursor to D Day.
