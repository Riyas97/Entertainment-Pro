In this film, Janis Lipzin blends her enduring interest in nature's volatile events with her sympathy with film's unpredictable response to light. She made a conscious decision to begin with film based on that medium's unduplicable and capricious reaction to photo-chemical stimuli. She used darkroom processes to produce outcomes that allude to (but don't truly describe) color in the natural world. Lipzin then interweaved the results with the more controllable properties of digital technology. By using both digital and analog tools, she was able to achieve results unattainable by either medium alone. The filmmaker's methods allow her to avoid many conventional industrial processes and vastly expand the boundaries of common color palettes.","release_date":"2009-01-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":4,"cert":"\"\"","id":425449,"title":"De Luce 1: Vegetare","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":[],"overview":"VIA RIO is an ode to our human desire for relationship.

What begins with Chaplin looping around in circular repetitions between a Keystone Kop and an ominous vagrant becomes more fractured as the film expands. News footage of police arresting protesters (shot from a television screen on black-and-white 8mm film) is cut into the comedy of cops and criminals (a shot of political reality through the slapstick fantasy) and images are abstracted by rapid-fire cutting. Even the physical cuts of the celluloid become part of the image as Levine chops through the frames themselves, leaving broad gashes on the screen and fracturing images until they overlap with the next shot and the suggestions of narrative are whirled into a frenzy of motion.","release_date":"1973-01-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":10,"cert":"\"\"","id":425462,"title":"The Big Stick\/An Old Reel","adult":false,"genre_ids":[]},{"cast":[],"overview":"NOTE TO POLI is, in the words of his student and fellow experimental filmmaker Marjorie Keller, \"a note to the filmmaker Poli Marichal 'about' penetration.\" P.
