The filmmakers use current technology and ideals of pleasure to depict this perfect future. Director Michael Anderson finds meshing these two worlds an exciting challenge, especially in trying to create something that has never been seen before in the movies. The studio's technology department plays a key role in creating Anderson and David's vision. The movie's stars, Michael York and Jenny Agutter, provide their take on the movie, their roles and working with each other and with fellow co-star Richard Jordan. The filmmakers also need to create the antithesis of the modern Utopian world for the scenes taking place outside of the domed world.","release_date":"","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":9,"cert":"N\/A","id":479827,"title":"A Look Into the 23rd Century","adult":false,"genre_ids":[99]},{"cast":["Chansangavej Chayanit","Peerapol Kijreunpiromsuk"],"overview":"A young woman's peaceful life is disrupted when an injured man suddenly enters her life.","release_date":"2018-08-23","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":87,"cert":"N\/A","id":479847,"title":"Someone from Nowhere","adult":false,"genre_ids":[18,9648]},{"cast":["Inge Meysel","Regine Lutz","Gisela Trowe","Manfred Steffen","Gundolf Willer"],"overview":"","release_date":"1967-08-21","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":479849,"title":"Palme im Rosengarten","adult":false,"genre_ids":[18]},{"cast":["Karin Baal","Leonard Steckel","Mario Adorf","Hela Gruel","Regine Lutz"],"overview":"","release_date":"1966-10-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":479851,"title":"Herr Puntila und sein Knecht Matti","adult":false,"genre_ids":[18]},{"cast":["Grete Wurm","Wolf Ackva","Bert Fortell","Konrad Georg","Regine Lutz"],"overview":"","release_date":"1964-07-11","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":479853,"title":"Nebeneinander","adult":false,"genre_ids":[18]},{"cast":["Bharath Margani","Srushti Dange","Tulasi","Thagubothu Ramesh","Nagineedu Vellanki"],"overview":"'Oye Ninne' charts the story of Vishnu, a young man who aspires to be a farmer while his parents want him to aim for something big.
