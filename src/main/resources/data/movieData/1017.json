For nearly a millennium, this vigorous and soulful music was part of the celebration of Jewish life in Eastern Europe. In the early decades of this century, the music took root in America. Klezmer musicians learned hundreds of tunes by ear and their ears were open to Gypsy, Ukrainian and Greek melodies of the old world, as well as to the new sounds of American jazz. Music born in Eastern Europe lived on in the imaginations of composers for New York's Yiddish theater, men whose tunes entered the mainstream through such unlikely adapters as the Andrew Sisters. Eventually Klezmer went underground as its audience assimilated into mainstream American culture.","release_date":"1987-01-01","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":80,"cert":"\"\"","id":508002,"title":"A Jumpin' Night in the Garden of Eden","adult":false,"genre_ids":[99]},{"cast":["Gilberto Gil","Sérgio Chiavazzoli","Marcos Suzano","Gustavo Di Dalva","Cícero Assis"],"overview":"","release_date":"2004-12-27","vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":508004,"title":"Gilberto Gil : Electroacústico","adult":false,"genre_ids":[10402]},{"cast":["Andy Quirke","Ruth McCabe","Simon Delaney","Graeme Singleton","Stephen Cromwell"],"overview":"Damo and Ivor embark on the mother of all adventures to find the last piece of their family puzzle and track down their long lost brother John Joe.","release_date":"2018-03-15","vote_average":9.7,"runtime":87,"cert":"N\/A","id":508006,"title":"Damo & Ivor: The Movie","adult":false,"genre_ids":[35]},{"cast":[],"overview":"A film to prove something, not for art.
